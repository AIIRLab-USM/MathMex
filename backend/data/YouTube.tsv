Contour plots | Multivariable calculus | Khan Academy	"What that's going to look like. So what we do is we say, ""Where do these slices cut into the graph?"" So I'm going to draw on all of the points where those slices cut into the graph and these are called contour lines."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsZj5Rb6do8#t=118.33s
Multivariable functions | Multivariable calculus | Khan Academy	These are called parametric surfaces. Another fun one is a vector field, where every input point is associated with some kind of vector, which is the output of the function there. So this would be a function with a two-dimensional input and a two-dimensional output 'cause each of these are two-dimensional vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrcCbdWwCBc#t=268.264s
Constrained optimization introduction	But that's not all you're asked to do, you're subject to a certain constraint where you're only allowed values of x and y on a certain set, and I'm just going to say, the set of all values of x and y, such that, x squared plus y squared, equals one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwUV2IDLP8Q#t=26.633s
Constrained optimization introduction	And what we're basically trying to do is find the maximum value that we can put here, the maximum value so that if we look at the line that represents f of x,y equals that value, it still intersects with the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwUV2IDLP8Q#t=338.46s
Quadratic approximation formula, part 1	- [Voiceover] So, our setup is that we have some kind of two variable function f of x, y, who has a scaler output, and the goal is to approximate it near a specific input point, and this is something I've already talked about in context of a local linearization, and I've written out the full local, the full local linearization, hard words to say, local linearization in its most abstract and general form, and it looks like quite the beast, but once you actually break it apart, which I'll do in a moment, it's, it's not actually that bad.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV5yj5A3QIM#t=0.0s
Quadratic approximation formula, part 1	Over here, this entire thing looks like a constant multiplied by x minus something, and if you differentiate this with respect to x, what you're gonna get is that constant term, which is the partial derivative of f evaluated at our, our specific point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV5yj5A3QIM#t=196.524s
Multivariable chain rule and directional derivatives	So here, just to be clear, you'd be thinking of whatever vector to your input point, that's p. But then the nudge, the nudge away from that input point is w. And you take the dot product between that and the vector itself, the vector that represents your nudge direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2mW2FQJgEE#t=175.836s
2d curl nuance	- [Voiceover] In the last couple videos I've been talking about curl where if we have a two dimensional vector field V defined with component functions P and Q, I've said that the 2D curl of that function V gives you a new function that also takes in x and y's inputs and it's formula is the partial derivative of Q with respect to x minus the partial derivative of P with respect to y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szLkF7isbI0#t=0.764s
Curvature formula, part 3	And then the second way you're thinking of this dt/ds, the change in the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length and taking its magnitude. And of course all of these are the same, they're just kind of three different ways to think about it or things that you might plug in when you come across a function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V4_4M90RfA#t=492.567s
Type II regions in three dimensions | Divergence theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Let's now think about Type 2 regions. And you'll see that they're kind of very similar definitions and it's really a question of orientation. Type 2 region is a region-- I'll call it R2-- that's the set of all x, y's, and z's in three dimensions such that-- and now instead of thinking of our domain in terms of xy-coordinates, we're going to think of them in terms of yz coordinates, such that our yz pairs are a member of some domain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ_2bATPi2I#t=0.53s
Type I regions in three dimensions | Divergence theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	But then I'll draw a couple of type 1 regions, and then I'll show you what would not be a type 1 region because sometimes that's the more important question. So type 1 region, maybe a type one region R, is the set-- and these little curly brackets means set-- is the set of all x, y's, and z's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A11AfJ2-3rE#t=27.91s
Line integrals and vector fields | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Displacement is just distance with some direction. Times the magnitude of the displacement, or you could say, times the distance displaced. And the classic example. Maybe you have an ice cube, or some type of block.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cJYNdQLYg#t=41.74s
Multivariable chain rule	And it's actually kind of surprising when you see it in this context, because it pops out in a way that you might not expect things to pop out. So, continuing our chugging along, when you take the derivative of this, you do the product rule, left d right, plus right d left, so in this case, the left is cosine squared of t, we just leave that as it is, cosine squared of t, and multiply it by the derivative of the right, d right, so that's going to be cosine of t, cosine of t, and then we add to that right, which is, keep that right side unchanged, multiply it by the derivative of the left, and for that we use the chain rule, the single variable chain rule, where you think of taking the derivative of the outside, so you plug two down, like you're taking the derivative of two x, but you're just writing in cosine, instead of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO3AqAaAE6o#t=181.77s
Multivariable chain rule	So this is the derivative, this is the derivative of the composition of functions that ultimately was a single variable function, but it kind of wind through two different variables. And I just want to make an observation in terms of the partial derivatives of f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO3AqAaAE6o#t=295.555s
Divergence theorem proof (part 2) | Divergence theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	And then I'll leave it up to you to do the exact same argument with a Type 2 and a Type 3 region. So let's get going. So Type 1 region, just to remind ourselves, a Type 1 region is a region that is equal to the set of all x, y's and z's such that the xy pairs are a member of a domain in the xy plane, and z is bounded by two functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM3e-J3euXo#t=66.777s
Scalar field line integral independent of path direction | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Let's let, let me get a nice substitution color, let's let u equal to a plus b minus t. So first we're going to have to figure out the boundaries of our integral, well actually, let's just figure out, what's du? so du dt, the derivative of u with respect to t is just going to be equal to minus 1, or we could say that du, if we multiply both sides by the differential dt, is equal to minus dt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99pD1-6ZpuM#t=661.04s
Quadratic approximation formula, part 2	Like for example, let's say we took the partial derivative first with respect to X, and then with respect to Y. This is called the mixed partial derivative. We want it to be the case that when we evaluate that at the point of interest it's the same as taking the mixed partial derivative of f with respect to X, and then with respect to Y, and we evaluate it at that same point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szHMvVXxp-g#t=105.87s
Introduction to 3d graphs | Multivariable calculus | Khan Academy	- [Voiceover] Hello everyone. So what I'd like to do here is to describe how we think about three-dimensional graphs. Three-dimensional graphs are a way that we represent certain kind of multi-variable function that kind of has two inputs, or rather a two-dimensional input, and then one-dimensional of output of some kind.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRmfxkH_VI#t=0.526s
Second partial derivative test intuition	And if this value H turns out to be less than zero, strictly less than zero, then you definitely have a saddle point, saddle point. Which is neither a maximum, nor a minimum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJo7D74PAak#t=117.257s
3d curl formula, part 2	So let me show you what I mean by that. If you're computing the determinant, of the guy that we have pictured there in the upper-right, you start by taking this upper-left component, and then multiplying it by the determinant of the sub-matrix, the sub-matrix whose rows are not the row of I and whose columns are not the row of I.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k4tWeI3R0Y#t=18.663s
3d curl formula, part 2	So here we have our vector function, vector-valued function V whose components are P, Q, and R, and when you go through this whole process of imagining the cross-product between the Del operator, this Nabla symbol, and the vector output P, Q, and R, what you get is this whole expression, and, you know, here we're writing with I, J, K notation, if you're writing it as a column vector, I guess I didn't erase some of these guys, but if you're writing this as a column vector, it would look like saying the curl of your vector valued function V as a function of X, Y, and Z is equal to, and then what I'd put in for this first component would be what's up there, so that would be your partial with respect to Y of R minus partial of Q with respect to Z, so partial of Q with respect to Z, and I won't copy it down for all of the other ones but in principle, you know, you'd kind of, whatever this J component is, and I guess we're subtracting it so you'd subtract there, you'd copy that as the next component and then over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k4tWeI3R0Y#t=164.948s
Double integral 1 | Double and triple integrals | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So you can kind of view it as the domain. Right? The domain is all of the set of valid things that you can input into a function. So now, before, our domain was just-- at least, you know, for most of what we dealt with-- was just the x-axis, or kind of the real number line in the x direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85zGYB-34jQ#t=162.81s
Gradient	And I'm just gonna make it a two-variable function. And let's say it's f of x, y, equals x-squared sine of y. The gradient is a way of packing together all the partial derivative information of a function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIpKfDc295M#t=32.164s
Gradient	This is a function that takes in a point in two-dimensional space and outputs a two-dimensional vector. So you could also imagine doing this with three different variables. Then you would have three partial derivatives, and a three-dimensional output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIpKfDc295M#t=152.047s
Line integral example 1 | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	And those small change in arc lengths, we called them ds, and then the height is just f of xy at that point. And we'll take an infinite sum of these, from t is equal to 0 to t will equal pi over 2, and then that should give us the area of this wall.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ8yc9Pdg#t=305.3s
3d vector fields, introduction | Multivariable calculus | Khan Academy	- [Voiceover] So in the last video, I talked about vector fields in the context of two dimensions, and here, I'd like to do the same but for three-dimensions. So a three-dimensional vector field is given by a function, a certain multi-variable function that has a three-dimensional input given with coordinates x, y and z, and then a three-dimensional vector output that has expressions that are somehow dependent on x, y, and z, I'll just put dots in here for now, but we'll fill this in with an example in just a moment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go3UvzbsSGo#t=0.445s
Local linearization	And what this basically means, the word local means you're looking at a specific input point. So in this case, it's a specific input point x nought, y nought, and the idea of a linearization, a linearization, means you're approximating the function with something simpler, with something that's actually linear, and I'll tell you what I mean by linear in, in just a moment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7_zS7Bx2VA#t=43.013s
Explicit Laplacian formula	In the last couple videos I told you about the Laplacian operator, which is a way of taking in your scalar valued function f and it gives you a new scalar valued function that's kind of like a second derivative thing because it takes the divergence of the gradient of your function f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cMn1F6bNPU#t=12.781s
Divergence intuition, part 2	But I want it to be something that's not just plopped down in front of you, but something that you actually, you know, feel deep in your bones. So a vector field like the one I have pictured above is given as a function, a multi-variable function, with a two-dimensional input, since it's a two-dimensional vector field, and then some kinda two-dimensional output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeie-aJT2eU#t=43.76s
3d curl formula, part 1	You take nabla, that upside-down triangle we used in divergence and gradient, and you imagine taking the cross-product between that and your vector V. As a reminder, this nabla, you imagine it as if it's a vector containing partial differential operators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_49iMi10kg#t=126.854s
2D divergence theorem | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Divergence is a measure of whether things are expanding or diverging or kind of contracting. If you have a point over here where around that, the particles are kind of moving away from each other, you would have a positive divergence here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoJGBr-tJXo#t=782.387s
2D divergence theorem | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	If you have a point, sometimes called a sync, where all of the particles are kind of condensing or converging you would have a negative divergence here. And now, so this should make a lot of sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoJGBr-tJXo#t=799.281s
The Lagrangian	Let me just kind of redraw it over here. You're looking at the point where the two functions are just tangent to each other is that the gradient, the gradient vector for the thing we're maximizing, which in this case is R, is gonna be parallel or proportional to the gradient vector of the constraint, which in this case is B, is gonna be proportional to the gradient of the constraint, and what this means is that if we were going to solve a set of equations, what you set up is you compute that gradient of R, and it'll involve two different partial derivatives, and you set it equal not to the gradient of B 'cause it's not necessarily equal to the gradient of B but it's proportional with some kind of proportionality constant, lambda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ4UNu1P2kw#t=138.172s
Meaning of Lagrange multiplier	And whatever the highest value this function can achieve, that is M star, that is the maximum possible revenue, subject to this budget. But it's interesting that when you solve this, you get some specific value of lambda, right, there's a specific lambda star that will be associated with the solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-G3K2GPmEQ#t=322.908s
2d curl example	You can kind see I'm just a sucker for symmetry when I choose examples. When I showed in the last video how the two dimensional curl, the 2D curl of a vector field, of a vector field v which is a function of x and y, is equal to the partial derivative of q, that second component, with respect to x minus the partial derivative of p that first component, with respect to y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAAEMza4GvQ#t=18.253s
Second partial derivative test example, part 2	And then we can't forget that last crucially important mixed partial derivative term. Which is the partial derivative of f. Where first we do it with respect to x, and then with respect to y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqslX-bUTD8#t=109.051s
Triple integrals 2 | Double and triple integrals | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So the mass around a very, very small point, and we called that d mass, the differential of the mass, is going equal the density at that point, or the rough density at exactly that point, times the volume differential around that point, times the volume of this little small cube.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQvL_WhBGU#t=81.17s
Controlling a plane in space	And then I have a plane that passes through it. And the goal of the video is going to be to find a function, a function that I'll call l, that takes in a two dimensional input x and y and this function l should have this plane as it's graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2hOwKszKRo#t=26.293s
Laplacian intuition	Points of high divergence, points where it diverges a lot here, why are those vectors pointing away? And if we pull up the graph again, the reason they're pointing away is 'cause the direction of steepest descent is kind of uphill everywhere; you are in a valley.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW08rD-GFh0#t=228.637s
Expressing a quadratic form with a matrix	And now what you do is you multiply the vector, the variable vector that's got x, y on the right side of this matrix and then you multiply it again but you turn it on its side so instead of being a vertical vector, you transpose it to being a horizontal vector on the other side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yEiCV-xEWQ#t=209.384s
Double integrals 4 | Double and triple integrals | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So we're going to do a double integral, a two-dimensional integral, we're saying that the domain here is two-dimensional, and we're going to take that over f of x and y times da.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twT-WZChfZ8#t=455.77s
Symmetry of second partial derivatives	But what's surprising is that this turns out to be true for, I mean, not all functions. There's actually a certain criterion. There's a special theorem, it's called Schwarz's theorem. Where if the second partial derivatives of your function are continuous at the relevant point, that's the circumstance for this being true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J08-L2buigM#t=320.776s
Gradient and contour maps	- [Voiceover] So here I want to talk about the gradient and the context of a contour map. So let's say we have a multivariable function. A two-variable function f of x,y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTbTYEMvo10#t=0.161s
Harmonic Functions	It's sort of the way to extend the idea of the second derivative into multiple dimensions. Now, what a harmonic function is, is one where the Laplacian is equal to zero. And it's equal to zero at every possible input point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQSC0lCPG24#t=36.631s
Curvature formula, part 1	It can get a little convoluted in terms of the symbols involved, and the constant picture you should have in the back of your mind is that circle, that circle that's hugging the curve very closely at a certain point, and this means of taking the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length is all just trying to capture that idea.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gspjhwSNMWs#t=343.315s
Curvature formula, part 4	So rather than drawing them stemming from the curve, to show that they're tangent, I just want to show them in their own space. The derivative, the change in that tangent vector, would be some, some other vector that tells you how you move from one to the other, kind of tells you how much it's turning.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmdN_iPhxAI#t=88.373s
Stokes' theorem proof part 4 | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So it's going to be dx-- let me write it this way. dx-- the derivative of x with respect to t-- dt-- that's the first expression-- plus n-- and then, the exact same thing-- times dy dt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1og25U-d3_8#t=256.69s
Multivariable maxima and minima	They're called local Minima, or local Maxima, sorry, so those guys are called local Maxima. Maxima is just the plural of Maximum, and local means that it's relative to a single point, so it's basically, if you walk in any direction, when you're on that little peak, you'll go downhill, so relative to the neighbors of that little point, it is a maximum, but relative to the entire function, these guys are the shorter mountains next to Mount Everest, but there's also another circumstance where you might find a flat tangent plane, and that's at the Minima points, right? If you have the global Minimum, the absolute smallest, or also just the local Minima, these inverted peaks, you'll also find flat tangent planes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7EQ3ip2DU#t=326.921s
Multivariable maxima and minima	Its first component is the partial derivative with respect to the first variable, its second component is the partial derivative with respect to the second variable, and if there's more variables, you would keep going, you'd say that this whole thing has to equal the zero vector, the vector that has nothing but zeroes as its components, and it's kind of a common, abusive notation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7EQ3ip2DU#t=402.249s
Finishing the intro lagrange multiplier example	- [Instructor] So in the last two videos we were talking about this constrained optimization problem where we want to maximize a certain function on a certain set, the set of all points x, y where x squared plus y squared equals one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aep6lwPqm6I#t=0.547s
Second partial derivative test example, part 1	So we have positive square root of three and Y equals one, and then we have negative square root of three and Y equals one. So these, these are the critical points, critical points, which basically means all partial derivatives are equal to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shWXeUn5BHk#t=346.552s
Divergence notation	- [Voiceover] So I've said that if you have a vector field, a two-dimensional vector field with component functions P and Q, that the divergence of this guy, the divergence of v, which is a scalar-valued function of x and y, is by definition, the partial derivative of P, with respect to x, plus the partial derivative of Q, with respect to y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyYlBXNETZE#t=0.172s
Divergence theorem proof (part 1) | Divergence theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Now, I want to be clear. What's going to happen right over here? If you take the dot product of i and n, you're just going to get the i-component, the scaling factor of the i-component of the n normal vector, and we're just going to multiply that times P.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCAFlt4pQSQ#t=171.01s
Quadratic approximation example	Next we'll do the mixed partial derivative, where you do first with respect to x, then with respect to y, or you could do it the other way, because with almost all functions, it kind of doesn't matter which order you take the two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW3snxnCPEY#t=202.192s
Surface integral ex3 part 3: Top surface | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So let's do it. So our surface integral, the thing that we were dealing with from the beginning, that thing right over there. Our surface integral, the surface s three, of z d s is now equal to, so I'm gonna use different colors for the different variables of integration, so one on the outside, and then I'll do one on the inside, I'll do the inside one in pink.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiVWafc3JBM#t=652.42s
Green's theorem proof (part 2) | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	And I'm interested in what the line integral, the closed line integral, around that path of F dot dr is. And we've seen it multiple times. dr is equal to dx i plus dy times j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdFD-0OWBRo#t=858.53s
Parabola vertex and axis of symmetry | Quadratic equations | Algebra I | Khan Academy	It's the maximum point. And the axis of symmetry is the line that you could reflect the parabola around, and it's symmetric. So that's the axis of symmetry. That is a reflection of the left-hand side along that axis of symmetry.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfoXtodyiIA#t=25.71s
Introduction to the quadratic equation | Quadratic equations | Algebra I | Khan Academy	The quadratic equation says that the roots of a quadratic are equal to -- and let's say that the quadratic equation is a x squared plus b x plus c equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWigvJcCAJ0#t=318.03s
Multiple examples graphing parabolas using roots and vertices | Algebra I | Khan Academy	We're going to write it in intercept form. That essentially means just writing it in it factored form. Then doing that, we're able to figure out the x-intercept, where we're intersecting the x-access, and then using that we'll be able to figure out the vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjkTEyO5Zso#t=96.86s
How to use the quadratic formula | Polynomial and rational functions | Algebra II | Khan Academy	In the future, we're going to introduce something called an imaginary number, which is a square root of a negative number, and then we can actually express this in terms of those numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7idZfS8t8w#t=557.91s
U.S. customary and metric units | Ratios, proportions, units, and rates | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	And it would change depending on what planet you're on. But on Earth, they tend to be used interchangeably, so we'll use it roughly interchangeably here. And then you have volume, or how much space something takes up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2RHWA7t0WM#t=162.59s
U.S. customary and metric units | Ratios, proportions, units, and rates | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	Millimeter. Meter is a unit. Meter right here, that is the unit of distance or of length. Millimeter, milli means 1/1,000 of a meter. Foot, that is also a unit of length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2RHWA7t0WM#t=216.11s
Unit conversion: arithmetic calculations on units of volume | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	And to make things confusing, they're actually very different things. Fluid ounces are a measure of a volume. Fluid ounces measure volume, just like cups and pints and quarts and gallons do.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShqXKpI6KA#t=18.09s
Ordering negative numbers | Negative numbers and absolute value | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	Would you rather have negative $40 in your bank account or negative $7 in your bank account? Negative 40 means that you owe the bank $40. So it's 40 less than having nothing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW6UrPKPInA#t=33.39s
Constructing and interpreting absolute value | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	A riparian buffer is an area around a stream that's covered in vegetation.

Constructing and interpreting absolute value | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	So let's say that I have a stream right over here. So this right over here is my stream, and the riparian buffer is an area around the stream that's covered in vegetation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FogJFEEYuO0#t=12.39s
Absolute value word problems | Negative numbers and absolute value | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	Let's do one more. No picture this time. I was getting used to that.

Dividing positive and negative numbers | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers: This is a positive divided by a positive. Which is going to be a positive. So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-KR3clFgs#t=100.612s
Introduction to radians | Unit circle definition of trig functions | Trigonometry | Khan Academy	And you see over here, this is 180 degrees.

Now let's look at the last choice. The subset consists of all the outcomes where there is not a tie."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uHhk7P9SNo#t=302.26s
Relative complement or difference between sets | Probability and Statistics | Khan Academy	So I'm going to take all of these things out. And so I'm just going to be left with the empty set, often called the null set. And sometimes the notation for that will look like this, the null set, the empty set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B4EBvVvf9w#t=351.72s
Distance formula | Analytic geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	The base goes straight left to right, the right side goes straight up and down, so we're dealing with a right triangle. So if we could just figure out what the base length is and what this height is, we could use the Pythagorean theorem to figure out this long side, the side that is opposite the right angle, the hypotenuse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyZuite17Pc#t=89.81s
Finite geometric series formula justification | High School Math | Khan Academy	Let's see, we can factor out an S sub n on the left hand side. You get an S sub n, the sub of our first n terms.

Introduction to function inverses | Functions and their graphs | Algebra II | Khan Academy	Our function, when you take 0-- so f of 0 is equal to 4. Our function is mapping 0 to 4. The inverse function, if you take f inverse of 4, f inverse of 4 is equal to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W84lObmOp8M#t=462.53s
Evaluating sequences in recursive form | Mathematics I | High School Math | Khan Academy	And this way of defining it, where we defined it as an algebraic function, a function that's defined over all positive integers, where we have a base case. And a base case, really, in this case, gave us our first term, and then we have this other case that's defined in terms of the function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjli0Gunkds#t=192.781s
Evaluating sequences in recursive form | Mathematics I | High School Math | Khan Academy	We have two base cases right over here. Base cases, cases that aren't defined in terms of the function itself.

Equation for parabola from focus and directrix | Conic sections | Algebra II | Khan Academy	- [Voiceover] What I have attempted to draw here in yellow is a parabola, and as we've already seen in previous videos, a parabola can be defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to a point and a line, and the point is called the focus of the parabola, and the line is called the directrix of the parabola.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okXVhDMuGFg#t=0.654s
Equation for parabola from focus and directrix | Conic sections | Algebra II | Khan Academy	So what we really want is the absolute value of this, or, we could square it, and then we could take the square root, the principle root, which would be equivalent to taking the absolute value of y minus k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okXVhDMuGFg#t=129.066s
Universal set and absolute complement | Probability and Statistics | Khan Academy	Now, let's say you have a subset of that universal set, set A.

What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	A domain is the set of all of the inputs over which the function is defined. So if this the domain here, if this is the domain here, and I take a value here, and I put that in for x, then the function is going to output an f(x).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96uHMcHWD2E#t=29.921s
What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	"That is called the range of the function. So the range. The range, and the most typical, there's actually a couple of definitions for range, but the most typical definition for range is ""the set of all possible outputs."" So you give me, you input something from the domain, it's going to output something, and by definition, because we have outputted it from this function, that thing is going to be in the range, and if we take the set of all of the things that the function could output, that is going to make up the range."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96uHMcHWD2E#t=76.591s
What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	The domain is the set of all valid inputs. So what are the valid inputs here?

A proportional relationship is one where, first of all, if you have zero x's, you're going to have zero y's, where y is equal to some constant times x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoKEPEPaNm4#t=74.05s
Ratios for recipes	And that's the notion of ratios. The ratios between ingredients or the ratio of how much of an ingredient you need for given guests. For example, you can see here that for every eight eggs, you have six cups of flour.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWO1m0S-a9Y#t=103.143s
Graphing proportional relationships example | 8th grade | Khan Academy	So let's think about some potential x and y values. So when we're thinking about proportional relationships, that means that y is going to be equal to some constant times x. So if we have a proportional relationship, if you have zero x's, it doesn't matter what your constant here is, you're going to have zero y's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F7LAJEVp-U#t=24.35s
What are variables, expressions, and equations? | Introduction to algebra | Algebra I | Khan Academy	An equation, you're essentially setting expressions to be equal to each other. That's why they're called equations. You're equating two things. An equation, you'll see one expression being equal to another expression.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDqOoI-4Z6M#t=152.226s
Introduction to proportional relationships | 7th grade | Khan Academy	- [Instructor] In this video, we are going to talk about proportional relationships, and these are relationships between two variables where the ratio between the variables is equivalent. Now that sounds complex or a little bit fancy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-HtxhClZ-0#t=0.13s
How to classify numbers | Numbers and operations | 8th grade | Khan Academy	So, let's call these, or the standard way of calling these things. These things can be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call these rational numbers. Rational numbers. And if something cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call irrational numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QHff5pRdM8#t=25.977s
How to classify numbers | Numbers and operations | 8th grade | Khan Academy	Integers. So, integers are numbers that don't have to be represented as a fraction or a decimal. So, these are integers, right over here. Integers. And then a subset of integers are whole numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QHff5pRdM8#t=75.496s
Constant of proportionality from equation	A constant of proportionality is what do you multiply x by to get to y? So y would be equal to our constant of proportionality times x. But this isn't written in that form, so what we do is manipulate it a little bit so that we can see it in that form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXtzBbU_cl8#t=17.356s
How to plot inequalities on a number line | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	So this symbol right over here, this is saying that C is less than or equal to 1,500 calories. So now 1,500 would be a completely legitimate C, a completely legitimate number of calories to have in a day.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilWDSYnTEFs#t=119.44s
Proportion word problem (example 1) | 7th grade | Khan Academy	And I'll show you why they're really the same thing. In cross-multiplication, whenever you have a proportion set up like this, people will multiply the diagonals. So when you use cross-multiplication, you'll say that 2 times 9 must be equal to question mark times 3, must be equal to whatever is in this question mark, the number of cups of flour times 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ywTWCaLmXE#t=182.42s
Polynomial approximation of functions (part 1)	Well, that's all good, but let's approximate it with a quadratic equation, with adding another x squared term. And we're going to do that way, but we're going to say, well, we said, when at x is equal to 0, the functions equal each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy132cgqaiU#t=273.76s
Implicit Differentiation	But I won't go into that. We're just learning implicit differentiation here. But it's sometimes it's fun to just think about things. So how's this different from everything else we learned so far? Well, here we have the derivative, the derivative is actually a function of both the x and the y value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6MC-lKOrw#t=606.79s
Polynomial approximations of functions (part 5)	Sine of 0 is 0. And then it starts to cycle again. The fifth derivative, 0 equal to 1. So we start with 0, then positive 1, then 0, then minus 1, then 0, then positive 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AoDucUmO20#t=155.49s
Definite Integrals (part 5)	Let's say I want to figure out the area inside of the curve where the height here is 32. So I want to figure out this area inside the curve. How do we do that? Well one way we could do it is just like we did the last one, we can figure out some function that's essentially a line, a horizontal line that goes straight across here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmXmRNFrtFw#t=336.95s
Graphing using derivatives | Derivative applications | Differential Calculus | Khan Academy	So let's figure out the critical points. The critical points are where this thing is either going to be equal to 0, or it's undefined. Now, I can look over the entire domain of real numbers, and this thing is defined pretty much anywhere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIgnece9ins#t=128.884s
Partial derivatives | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	We have to pick a direction. We have to hold everything else constant and take the derivative with respect to just one variable. And that is called the partial derivative. I know it sounds fancy, but you'll see.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CMDS4-PKKQ#t=456.93s
Polynomial approximation of functions (part 4)	What's f 4 of x? The fourth derivative of x? It equals cosine of x again. As we keep taking derivatives we'll keep repeating and the pattern will go on, right? The fifth derivative of x, the fifth derivative of this function, the fourth is the same as a function, so the fifth is going to be the same as the first derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcJeg4SdIpU#t=62.2s
Line integrals and vector fields | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Displacement is just distance with some direction. Times the magnitude of the displacement, or you could say, times the distance displaced. And the classic example. Maybe you have an ice cube, or some type of block.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cJYNdQLYg#t=41.74s
Approximating functions with polynomials (part 3)	I had dinner between the last video and this one. So I might have forgotten what I just did. I think I was about to-- if what I see on my board makes sense-- I was about to use the Taylor series, or in this specific example the Maclaurin series approximation, to figure out a polynomial version, a sum of polynomial terms to approximate e to the x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZDGrbyz0v0#t=0.7s
Mean value theorem | Derivative applications | Differential Calculus | Khan Academy	So a function just has to be continuous. And now what does differentiable mean? Differentiable means that at every point over the interval that we care about, you have to be able to find the derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGNMXfaNR5Q#t=231.72s
Trig Implicit Differentiation Example	Well that's pretty straightforward, that's just 1. Plus the derivative of y with respect to x. So let me write it like this. I'll write the derivative operator, the derivative oh y with respect to x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xvwyE67CeM#t=98.61s
Scalar field line integral independent of path direction | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Let's let, let me get a nice substitution color, let's let u equal to a plus b minus t. So first we're going to have to figure out the boundaries of our integral, well actually, let's just figure out, what's du? so du dt, the derivative of u with respect to t is just going to be equal to minus 1, or we could say that du, if we multiply both sides by the differential dt, is equal to minus dt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99pD1-6ZpuM#t=661.04s
Extreme derivative word problem (advanced) | Differential Calculus | Khan Academy	So this curve right there is y is equal to x squared. Let us define a normal line as a line whose first quadrant intersection with the parabola is perpendicular to the parabola.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaPc8zDcRI#t=20.19s
Extreme derivative word problem (advanced) | Differential Calculus | Khan Academy	Because the problem wants us to find that point, the maximum point of intersection. They call this the extreme normal line. The extreme normal line is when our second quadrant intersection essentially achieves a maximum point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaPc8zDcRI#t=1085.88s
2011 Calculus BC free response #6a | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	So let's do this first part. And just a reminder, a Taylor Series is a polynomial approximation of a function. So just to give us a quick reminder. We go into much more detail in this on the videos about Taylor series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BGlbx67B6s#t=31.27s
Double integral 1 | Double and triple integrals | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So you can kind of view it as the domain. Right? The domain is all of the set of valid things that you can input into a function. So now, before, our domain was just-- at least, you know, for most of what we dealt with-- was just the x-axis, or kind of the real number line in the x direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85zGYB-34jQ#t=162.81s
2011 Calculus AB free response #4c | AP Calculus AB | Khan Academy	So an inflection point is a point where the sign of the second derivative changes. So if you take the second derivative at that point, or as we go close to that point, or as we cross that point, it goes from positive to negative or negative to positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ADc9jkBig#t=11.46s
Line integral example 1 | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	And those small change in arc lengths, we called them ds, and then the height is just f of xy at that point. And we'll take an infinite sum of these, from t is equal to 0 to t will equal pi over 2, and then that should give us the area of this wall.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ8yc9Pdg#t=305.3s
Euler's formula & Euler's identity | Series | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	I is defined by engineers for simplicity so that they can find the roots of all sorts of polynomials. As you could say the square root of negative one. Pi is the ratio between the circumference of a circle and it's diameter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgNtPOgFje0#t=611.265s
Calculus: Maximum and minimum values on an interval	Well what are the critical points? They're the points where either the derivative is 0, or the derivative doesn't exist. Now this brings up an interesting point. We'll see in a second there's a point here where the derivative doesn't exist, but the function also isn't defined at that point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzmSKrwiG3g#t=343.59s
2011 Calculus AB free response #4b | AP Calculus AB | Khan Academy	At which point, the maximum would be at this critical point. And I say critical point, as opposed to just a point where the slope is zero, because it's possible to the functions not differentiable there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvMBNVi5bLY#t=66.72s
2011 Calculus AB free response #5c. | AP Calculus AB | Khan Academy	And the main class of differential equations that you could solve are the ones that are separable differential equations. The ones where you can separate the independent and the dependent variables. And if you don't have any idea what I'm talking about, I'm about to show you.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-2Uw10QgIo#t=40.73s
Divergence 2 | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So obviously, in any given amount of time, that point is getting more and more dense. And the classic example of a positive divergence is a point where from every direction things are leaving it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOX3RkH2guE#t=478.02s
Maclaurin series of sin(x) | Series | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	The fourth derivative is the derivative of this, which is positive sine of x again. So you see, just like cosine of x, it kind of cycles after you take the derivative enough times.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlKvubIqHc8#t=67.79s
Monotonicity Theorem	But having a positive slope means that the value of the function is increasing. For every change it x, there's a positive change in y. And similarly, a negative slope says that for every change in x, no matter how small, there's a negative change in y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrEcQsa-1ME#t=96.4s
Taylor polynomial remainder (part 1) | Series | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	So I want a Taylor polynomial centered around there. And we've seen how this works. The Taylor polynomial comes out of the idea that for all of the derivatives up to and including the degree of the polynomial, those derivatives of that polynomial evaluated at a should be equal to the derivatives of our function evaluated at a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgkRH5Uoavk#t=25.59s
Taylor polynomial remainder (part 1) | Series | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	So the error at a is equal to f of a minus P of a. And once again, I won't write the sub-N, sub-a. You can assume it, this is an Nth degree polynomial centered at a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgkRH5Uoavk#t=322.777s
Definite integrals (part II)	From t equals 0 to t equals 10. and I'm going to take the sum of each of the heights, the height at any given point, which is the velocity. And then, what's the formula for the velocity? It's 32t and then I'm at times the base at each of these rectangles, dt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PaFm_Je5A0#t=225.56s
2D divergence theorem | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	Divergence is a measure of whether things are expanding or diverging or kind of contracting. If you have a point over here where around that, the particles are kind of moving away from each other, you would have a positive divergence here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoJGBr-tJXo#t=782.387s
2D divergence theorem | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	If you have a point, sometimes called a sync, where all of the particles are kind of condensing or converging you would have a negative divergence here. And now, so this should make a lot of sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoJGBr-tJXo#t=799.281s
Inflection Points and Concavity Intuition	We're still downward sloping, but even less steep. And that keeps happening. We keep getting less and less downward sloping, or less steep in the downward direction, until we get to this minimum point, and you've seen this before, where our slope actually gets to zero, and it just keeps increasing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIE22eL6q90#t=196.92s
Inflection Points and Concavity Intuition	And this would also be called an inflection point if it was the other way. If we went from a curve-- let me draw a curve that looks like this-- that was concave upwards and then it's concave downwards, the point that we're switching, the point at which you go from one to the other, essentially your rate of the change of slope switches signs, that is an inflection.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIE22eL6q90#t=593.53s
Inflection Points and Concavity Intuition	So what did we say about concave upwards? concave upwards is when the slope is increasing, which means that the rate of change of the slope is positive. Well, what that means is that the second derivative, which is the slope of the slope, f prime of x, is going to be greater than zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIE22eL6q90#t=665.44s
Inflection Points and Concavity Intuition	If the slope is decreasing, then the rate of change of slope is negative, which tells us that the second derivative is negative. And the point in which you're switching from a positive second derivative to a negative one or a negative one to a positive one, that is what is called an inflection point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIE22eL6q90#t=801.25s
Periodic Definite Integral	For any real number x, let brackets around x denote the largest integer less than or equal to x, often known as the greatest integer function. Let f be a real valued function defined on the interval negative 10 to 10, including the boundaries by f of x is equal to x minus the greatest integer of x, if the greatest integer of x is odd, and 1 plus the greatest integer of x minus x, if the greatest integer of x is even.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZdziIlYIfI#t=0.62s
Triple integrals 2 | Double and triple integrals | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So the mass around a very, very small point, and we called that d mass, the differential of the mass, is going equal the density at that point, or the rough density at exactly that point, times the volume differential around that point, times the volume of this little small cube.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQvL_WhBGU#t=81.17s
Taylor polynomial remainder (part 2) | Series | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	But this is the m plus 1th derivative. We bounded it's absolute value but we really want to bound the actual error function. The 0 is the derivative, you could say, the actual function itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUUPP70Fhpo#t=258.589s
Taylor polynomial remainder (part 2) | Series | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	That's going to be greater than or equal to, and I think you'll see why I'm why I'm doing this in a second. Greater than or equal to the absolute value, the absolute value of the integral of, of the n plus 1th derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUUPP70Fhpo#t=449.84s
Double integrals 4 | Double and triple integrals | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So we're going to do a double integral, a two-dimensional integral, we're saying that the domain here is two-dimensional, and we're going to take that over f of x and y times da.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twT-WZChfZ8#t=455.77s
Rates-of-change (part 2)	So let me say that-- let's call r. r is not for ripple. r is the distance that the ripple is from the center from where it started from the get go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmgk8_l3lig#t=38.62s
Rates-of-change (part 2)	So the derivative of an area of a circle with respect to the radius is a circumference. That is mildly fascinating. Something even more interesting is to figure out what the antiderivative is of the area and compare that to the volume of a sphere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmgk8_l3lig#t=209.35s
Polynomial approximation of functions (part 2)	So we are going to define this polynomial p of x. It's going to be the infinite series, the infinite sum. Let's start with n is equal to 0, and we're going to go to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JG3qn7-Sac#t=379.09s
Sequences and series (part 2)	So this is neat. We're going to take an infinite sum, an infinite number of terms, and let's see if we can actually get an actual number. You know, we take an infinite thing, add it up, and it actually adds up to a finite thing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_8GRLJplZg#t=445.91s
Graphing with Calculus	Well they're saying that the second derivative is greater than 0 from 0 to 5. So from 0 to 5. So this is 5 right here. What does this tells? This means that we are concave upwards from 0 to 5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojcp0GJKluM#t=378.44s
The Chain Rule	Welcome back. I'm now going to do some more examples of a bit of a review of some of the derivatives that we've been seeing. And then I'll introduce you to something called the chain rule which expands the universe of the types of functions we can take the derivatives of.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIQ-KnsAsbg#t=0.96s
Sequences and Series (part 1)	We'll actually focus on this one and the geometric series because those are the two that you'll see most often. And then once you learn calculus, I'll show you the power and Taylor series, which is exact-- the Taylor series is a specific version of a power series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgVJrSJxkDk#t=110.73s
Taylor Polynomials	So what is that? Let me just write the definition down, and then we'll do a couple of examples, and then we'll graph it to get the intuition. So a Taylor polynomial says that if I have a differentiable function f of x, and I want to approximate it with a polynomial at c, so at some value of x equals c, I want to approximate this function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SsC5st4LnI#t=33.68s
Taylor Polynomials	The big picture is, the whole thinking behind, I guess, what Taylor thought of, was, wow. If this function is infinitely differentiable, meaning that I can take the first, second, third, fourth, you know, all the way to infinity derivative of this function, I could construct a polynomial like this, and i can just keep going by adding more and more terms, so that this polynomial's, you know, zeroth derivative, which is means the function, the 0, first, second, third, fourth, all of this polynomial's derivatives are going to be equal to the function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SsC5st4LnI#t=389.57s
Taylor Polynomials	So then we're going to take the fourth derivative, which is the derivative of the third derivative, so the third derivative was positive sine, so now we're going to be plus cosine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SsC5st4LnI#t=631.54s
AP Calculus BC exams: 2008 1 c&d | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	So far this might look pretty similar to part a, but what's the twist here? We want the area. The area of each of the squares, not just this distance. So what's the area? It's going to be this distance squared, so we have to square this entire thing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l0Mfsu__gU#t=170.59s
AP Calculus BC exams: 2008 1 c&d | AP Calculus BC | Khan Academy	But this is kind of, I think, what they wanted you to do, set up the integral, recognize that each of the squares, the area of each of the squares is just going to be this distance, the distance between the functions squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l0Mfsu__gU#t=377.22s
Surface integral ex3 part 3: Top surface | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	So let's do it. So our surface integral, the thing that we were dealing with from the beginning, that thing right over there. Our surface integral, the surface s three, of z d s is now equal to, so I'm gonna use different colors for the different variables of integration, so one on the outside, and then I'll do one on the inside, I'll do the inside one in pink.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiVWafc3JBM#t=652.42s
Green's theorem proof (part 2) | Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy	And I'm interested in what the line integral, the closed line integral, around that path of F dot dr is. And we've seen it multiple times. dr is equal to dx i plus dy times j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdFD-0OWBRo#t=858.53s
Optimization with Calculus 3	So that's the area of the square. But we want to know the combined area of both of them. So what's the function for the combined area? So the combined area, and I'll do it in a bold color, area of both of them, I'll say area combined, that's equal to the area of the square plus the area of the triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Wtu-kdDC4#t=380.24s
Eigenvectors and eigenspaces for a 3x3 matrix | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	We can say that the eigenspace for lambda is equal to 3, is the set of all of vectors, v1, v2, v3, that are equal to a times times-- v2 is a, right? So v2 is equal to a times 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Md5KCCQX-0#t=300.2s
Vector transformations | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So if this is my first set, x. We call that the domain. And the set that we're mapping to, y, in this case, that's called the codomain. And the function just maps each of the specific entries of x to an entry in y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAbadNuQEjI#t=12.25s
Vector transformations | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	But it really is the exact same thing as a function. I don't want to confuse you, because if you watch the differential equations playlist, you saw the idea of a Laplace transformation, which is really an operation that takes a function as an argument.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAbadNuQEjI#t=675.0s
Linear combinations and span | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	R2 is all the tuples made of two ordered tuples of two real numbers. So it equals all of R2. This just means that I can represent any vector in R2 with some linear combination of a and b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm_OS-8COwU#t=500.12s
Linear combinations and span | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So it's really just scaling. You can't even talk about combinations, really. So it's just c times a, all of those vectors. And we saw in the video where I parametrized or showed a parametric representation of a line, that this, the span of just this vector a, is the line that's formed when you just scale a up and down.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm_OS-8COwU#t=676.69s
Dimension of the null space or nullity | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	But the dimensionality, the dimension, of a subspace-- I'll redefine it here-- is the number of elements in a basis for the subspace. And in the last video I took great pains to show that all bases for any given subspace will have the same number of elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abYAUqs_n6I#t=668.08s
Dimension of the null space or nullity | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Or another way to think about it-- or another name for the dimension of the null space of B-- is the nullity, the nullity of B. And that is also equal to 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abYAUqs_n6I#t=724.67s
Visualizing a projection onto a plane | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And then if you add v to both sides, you get w plus v is equal to x. We defined v to be, the orthogonal-- the projection of x onto v. w is a member of our orthogonal complement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbZlJURkfA#t=515.82s
Visualizing a projection onto a plane | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And I don't want you to get confused. The vector v is the orthogonal projection of our vector x onto the subspace capital V. I probably should use different letters instead of using a lowercase and a uppercase v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbZlJURkfA#t=531.05s
Proof: Any subspace basis has same number of elements |  Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Now I think you and I could both agree that this set is linearly dependent. How do I know that? Linear dependence means that at least one of the elements of the set can be represented as a linear combination of the others.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn2K8UIT8r4#t=132.35s
Proof: Any subspace basis has same number of elements |  Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	They both come from that spanning basis. The fact that they are a basis -- the word spanning basis, I shouldn't say it like that, because it's redundant. A basis is a spanning set that is linearly independent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn2K8UIT8r4#t=613.63s
Classic video on inverting a 3x3 matrix part 2 | Matrices | Precalculus | Khan Academy	And we wanted to find the inverse of this matrix. So this is what we're going to do. It's called Gauss-Jordan elimination, to find the inverse of the matrix. And the way you do it-- and it might seem a little bit like magic, it might seem a little bit like voodoo, but I think you'll see in future videos that it makes a lot of sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obts_JDS6_Q#t=63.85s
Showing that an eigenbasis makes for good coordinate systems | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	n linearly independent vectors in Rn are a basis for Rn. But when you use that basis, when you use the linearly independent eigenvectors of A as a basis, we call this an eigenbasis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2PC9185gIw#t=662.35s
A more formal understanding of functions | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	I, as the function creator, have to tell you that every valid input here has to be a set of real numbers. Now the set that I'm mapping to is called the codomain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQMyeQOLvpg#t=287.66s
A more formal understanding of functions | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So the codomain is a set that you're mapping to, and in this example this is the codomain. In this example, the real numbers are the domain and the codomain. So the question is how does the range relate to this? So the codomain is the set that can be possibly mapped to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQMyeQOLvpg#t=335.61s
A more formal understanding of functions | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	It could be equal to the codomain. It's some subset. A set is a subset of itself, every member of a set is also a member of itself, so it's a subset of itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQMyeQOLvpg#t=367.92s
A more formal understanding of functions | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Now what is my codomain? My codomain is the set that I'm potentially mapping to, and is part of the function definition. This by definition is the codomain. So my codomain is R.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQMyeQOLvpg#t=493.31s
A more formal understanding of functions | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Now what is the range of my function? The range is the set of values that the function actually maps to. In this case, we always map to the value 2, so the range is actually just the value 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQMyeQOLvpg#t=510.03s
Basis of a subspace | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Now before I kind of give you the punchline, let's review what exactly span meant. Span meant that this set, this subspace, represents all of the possible linear combinations of all of these vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zntNi3-ybfQ#t=50.37s
Basis of a subspace | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So first of all, let's just think about the span, the span of this set of vectors. This is a set of vectors. So what's the span of S? What's all of the linear combinations of this? Well, let's see if it's all of r2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zntNi3-ybfQ#t=391.61s
Matrix condition for one-to-one trans | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So it's going to be b minus b, so that's going to be equal to the 0 vector. Or another way to think about it is, x, the vector x minus our particular solution is a solution to A times x is equal to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3FuL9qKTBs#t=533.87s
im(T): Image of a transformation | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Although, that's kind of redundant with the closure under scalar multiplication. Fair enough. Now, let's say that I also have some transformation T. It is a mapping, a function, from Rn to Rm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ827mfh1Jo#t=105.08s
im(T): Image of a transformation | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And that is the correct terminology when you're dealing with a subset. But when you take, all of a sudden, the entire n dimensional space, and you're finding that image, we call that the image of the actual transformation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ827mfh1Jo#t=725.77s
im(T): Image of a transformation | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And so the image of any linear transformation, which means the subset of its codomain, when you map all of the elements of its domain into its codomain, this is the image of your transformation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ827mfh1Jo#t=948.52s
Surjective (onto) and injective (one-to-one) functions | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So that is my set x or my domain. And then this is the set y over here, or the co-domain. Remember the co-domain is the set that you're mapping to. You don't necessarily have to map to every element of the set, or none of the elements of the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNX8BUWR0g#t=25.31s
Surjective (onto) and injective (one-to-one) functions | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	You could also say that your range of f is equal to y. Remember the difference-- and I drew this distinction when we first talked about functions --the distinction between a co-domain and a range, a co-domain is the set that you can map to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNX8BUWR0g#t=327.45s
Surjective (onto) and injective (one-to-one) functions | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	You don't have to map to everything. The range is a subset of your co-domain that you actually do map to. If you were to evaluate the function at all of these points, the points that you actually map to is your range.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNX8BUWR0g#t=341.68s
Unique rowspace solution to Ax = b | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Now, let's say that I have some other vector b. Let's say b is a member of the column space of A. Remember, the column space is just the set of all of the vectors that can be represented as a linear combination of the columns of A, so that means that b can be represented as a linear combination of the columns of A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIYvs9zj2g#t=15.52s
Unique rowspace solution to Ax = b | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	I have the null space and then I have the null space's complement, orthogonal complement, which is the row space of A. Now, we've seen in several videos now, and I proved it I think two videos ago, that any vector in Rn can be represented as a sum of a member of our null space, let's call that vector n, and let's say some vector in our row space, let's call that vector r.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIYvs9zj2g#t=224.73s
Orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	That's the only factor in rn when you take its length and, especially when you square it, you get 0. But you could just take its length. So what does that mean? That means that our original vector x is equal to v plus w.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlI8mx8Hc8o#t=374.81s
Preimage of a set | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	This notation right here just means subset, some subset of T. We've defined the notion of an image of T of A like that, which is the image of A, of our subset A, under T.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVsGtU8lIWs#t=40.09s
Preimage of a set | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Preimage, we go from a subset of our codomain, and we say what subset of our domain maps into that subset of our codomain? Now let me ask you an interesting question, and this is kind of for bonus points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVsGtU8lIWs#t=239.05s
Another example of a projection matrix | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Which is equal to what? Remember, the null space, its orthogonal complement-- a null space's orthogonal complement is equivalent to the row space or the column space of A transpose. We saw that multiple times.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhCSHu6dHb8#t=695.34s
dim(v) + dim(orthogonal complement of v) = n | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	This was equal to the number of, well, for this B's case, the rank of B is just equal to the number of pivot columns I have. Now the nullity is the dimension of your null space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGhBfkBqok0#t=388.44s
Projections onto subspaces with orthonormal bases | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	We saw in the last video that orthonormal bases make for good coordinate systems, coordinate systems where it's easy to figure out the coordinates. That's what we did in the last video.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we829K4NOq8#t=0.69s
Vector dot product and vector length | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	These two things are equivalent. So we could write our definition of length, of vector length, we can write it in terms of the dot product, of our dot product definition. It equals the square root of the vector dotted with itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNuIhXo39_k#t=498.22s
Transpose of a matrix | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	If you were to take the transpose again of that, he would then become the second row and third column again.

Determinant and area of a parallelogram | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Let me write that down. The height squared is the height squared right there. So what is our area squared going to be? Our area squared-- let me go down here where I'll have more space-- our area squared is going to be equal to our base squared, which is v1 dot v1 times our height squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-S63_goDFg#t=788.52s
Determinant and area of a parallelogram | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	If you want, you can just multiply this guy out and you'll get that right there. But what is this? What is this thing right here? It's the determinant. This is the determinant of our original matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-S63_goDFg#t=1131.01s
Orthogonal complement of the nullspace | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So this is just equal to the column space of A. So we now see some nice symmetry. The nullspace is the orthogonal complement of the row space, and then we see that the row space is the orthogonal complement of the nullspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE_aQAur7nI#t=173.07s
Coordinates with respect to a basis | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Let's say v1 is the vector 2, 1. And let's say v2 is the vector 1, 2. Now you might immediately see that the basis, or the set, of v1 and v2, this is a basis for R2, which means that any vector in R2 can be represented as a linear combination of these guys.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvgru6FcyxU#t=219.28s
Visualizations of left nullspace and rowspace | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So we have our null space, which is the span of these two vectors in R3. It's a little bit more difficult to draw it, these two vectors in R3 right there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW8ZPjGlk24#t=657.31s
Visualizations of left nullspace and rowspace | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	That is the spanning vector of my row space. Just let me actually create that. So let me say that v4 is a member of my row space, which is the column space of the transpose of A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW8ZPjGlk24#t=909.49s
Introduction to eigenvalues and eigenvectors | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And so these have special names. Any vector that satisfies this right here is called an eigenvector for the transformation T. And the lambda, the multiple that it becomes-- this is the eigenvalue associated with that eigenvector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhfbEr2btGQ#t=283.62s
Introduction to the inverse of a function | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So let's write it here. So f inverse is a mapping from Y to X. f inverse, if you give me some value in set Y, I go to set X.

Defining a plane in R3 with a point and normal vector | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	If I give you a normal vector and I tell you that normal vector is the point 1, 3, minus 2 and I say that it intersects the point, or a point that lies on the plane-- The normal vector and the point don't necessarily have to intersect.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJxgcVaNTqY#t=617.59s
Finding eigenvectors and eigenspaces example | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And we get lambda times the identity matrix minus A times my eigenvector have got to be equal to 0. Or another way to say it is, for any lambda eigenvalue, and let me write it for any eigenvalue lambda, the eigenvectors that correspond to that lambda, we can call that the eigenspace for a lambda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-xfmbdzkqc#t=141.71s
Finding eigenvectors and eigenspaces example | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	The null space of this matrix is the set of all of the vectors that satisfy this or all of the eigenvectors that correspond to this eigenvalue.

Parametric representations of lines | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Or visually you could just say, heads to tails, so I would go right there. So I would end up at a corresponding point over there. So when I define my set, s, as the set of all points where I just multiply v times the scalar, I got this thing that went through the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWhs2cIj7Cw#t=480.86s
Parametric representations of lines | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And there's no reason why we have to just stop at three, three coordinates, right here. We could have done this with fifty dimensions. We could have defined a line in fifty dimensions-- or the set of vectors that define a line, that two points sit on, in fifty dimensions-- which is very hard to visualize, but we can actually deal with it mathematically.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWhs2cIj7Cw#t=1465.48s
Column space of a matrix | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So the column space of A, this is my matrix A, the column space of that is all the linear combinations of these column vectors.

A projection onto a subspace is a linear transformation  | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	We said that the projection onto v of x is equal to Ay for some y that is a member of Rk. If we knew what that y was, if we could always solve for that y, then the projection of x would be well defined.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTyNpXB92bQ#t=641.59s
A projection onto a subspace is a linear transformation  | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And this thing right here, this long convoluted thing, that's just some matrix, some matrix which always exists for any subspace that has some basis.

Showing that A-transpose x A is invertible | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Right? Let's say v is a k by 1 matrix. v transpose will be a 1 by k matrix. We've seen this before. That that is equal to the reverse product, the transpose of the reverse product.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESSMQH6Y5OA#t=372.73s
Singular matrices | Matrices | Precalculus | Khan Academy	Perhaps even more interesting than finding the inverse of a matrix is trying to determine when an inverse of a matrix doesn't exist. Or when it's undefined. And a square matrix for which there is no inverse, of which an inverse is undefined is called a singular matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqyN7-tRS00#t=0.62s
Rowspace solution to Ax = b example | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And then we would have x1 is equal to 2/3 times t. So the null space of our matrix, the null space of A, is going to be equal to the set of all x1, x2's, that are equal to some real number t times the vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdf2CuMGdKs#t=132.6s
Rowspace solution to Ax = b example | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So that's in my null space. So if I were to dot it with any member of my row space, it's going to be equal to 0. The row space is the orthogonal complement of the null space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdf2CuMGdKs#t=949.45s
Simplifying conditions for invertibility | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And we did several videos where we thought well if we had a transformation, a linear transformation, that's defined by a matrix, A, where this would be an m-by-n matrix, we said that this is going to be met if the rank-- This is only met if the rank of A is equal to the number of rows in your transformation matrix is equal to m.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz2OosyMTmY#t=58.7s
Compositions of linear transformations 2 | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	We were trying to find some-- let me write down and summarize everything that we've done so far.

I'm taking the vectors x and the vectors y. By definition, what is this equal to? This is equal to applying to linear transformation T to the linear transformation S, applied to our two vectors, x plus y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_DTiXZpb8M#t=440.27s
Compositions of linear transformations 1 | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	We know that is true. We know that we can replace this thing right there with that thing right there. We also know that T is a linear transformation. Which means that the transformation applied to the sum of two vectors is equal to the transformation of each of the vectors summed up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_DTiXZpb8M#t=491.4s
Proof of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	When you sum them up, you're going to have something greater than or equal to 0.

Projections onto subspaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So this right here, that right there, was the projection onto the line L of the vector x. And we defined it more formally. We kind of took a perpendicular. We said that x minus the projection of x onto L is perpendicular to the line L, or perpendicular to everything-- orthogonal to everything-- on the line L.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B8XluiqdHM#t=81.79s
Introduction to orthonormal bases | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Or they're all unit vectors. Normalized vectors are vectors that you've made their lengths 1. You're turned them into unit vectors. They have all been normalized. So that's the first interesting thing about my set, B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BFx8pt2aTQ#t=91.03s
Introduction to orthonormal bases | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So let's say that B is the basis for some subspace, v. Or we could say that v is equal to the span of v1, v2, all the way to vk. Then we called B-- if it was just a set, we'd call it a orthonormal set, but it can be an orthonormal basis when it's spans some subspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BFx8pt2aTQ#t=445.79s
Linear subspaces | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Let's pick one of the elements. Let me define, let me just call u to be the set-- the set of all linear combinations of this is the span. So let me just define u to be the span.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMFv6liWK4M#t=898.5s
Linear subspaces | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	This is clearly another linear combination of these three vectors. So, the span is the set of all of the linear combinations of these three vectors. So clearly this is one of the linear combinations, so it's also included in the span.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMFv6liWK4M#t=1048.89s
Linear subspaces | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	And if there are other vectors, you would add it to those as well. But this is clearly going to be the 0 vector. So it contains the 0 vector. Is it closed under multiplication? Well, the span is the set of all the vectors, where, if you take all of the real numbers for c and you multiply it times 1, 1, that is the span.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMFv6liWK4M#t=1258.18s

Representing vectors in rn using subspace members | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Well, if x is equal to the left-hand side, it's also equal to the right-hand side.

Least squares approximation | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	The closest vector to b, that's in my subspace, is going to be the projection of b onto my column space. That is the closest vector there.

rank(a) = rank(transpose of a) | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	That's the definition of the rank. The dimension of the column space of A transpose is the number of basis vectors for the column space of A transpose. That's what dimension is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqqVOWm9YsU#t=40.02s
rank(a) = rank(transpose of a) | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	When you put A into reduced row echelon form, we learned that the basis vectors, or the basis columns that form a basis for your column space, are the columns that correspond to the pivot columns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqqVOWm9YsU#t=589.45s
rank(a) = rank(transpose of a) | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So we could say that the rank of A is equal to the number of pivot entries in the reduced row echelon form of A. And, as you can see very clearly, that's the exact same thing that we deduced was equivalent to the rank of A transpose-- the dimension of the columns space of A transpose.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqqVOWm9YsU#t=633.2s
Null space and column space basis | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So let's figure out what the null space of A is. And remember, we can do a little shortcut here. The null space of A is equal to the null space of the row, the reduced row echelon form of A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uTAdf_AsfQ#t=104.78s
Null space and column space basis | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	1, 2, 3, 4. The null space is the set of all of vectors that satisfy this equation, where we're going to have three 0's right here. That's the 0 vector in R3, because we have three rows right there, and you can figure it out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uTAdf_AsfQ#t=350.17s
Null space and column space basis | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	I just wrote it out like that. And I said, well it's not clear whether this is a valid basis for the column space of A. And what's a basis? A basis is a set of vectors that span a subspace, and they are also linearly independent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uTAdf_AsfQ#t=900.49s
Rowspace and left nullspace | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	That are equal to what? Well, x2 and x3 are free variables. They're associated with the non-pivot entries, or the non-pivot columns in our reduced row echelon form. That is a pivot column right there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBfc57x_RSg#t=274.96s
Rowspace and left nullspace | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Now what is the columnspace? The columnspace of A tranpose? Well, the columnspace of A transpose is the set of all vectors spanned by the columns of A. So you could just say the span of this column vector and this column vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBfc57x_RSg#t=776.09s
Rowspace and left nullspace | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So the columnspace of the transpose of any matrix, this is called the rowspace of A. And it's a very natural name. Because if A's got a bunch of rows, we could call them the transpose of some vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBfc57x_RSg#t=913.87s
Linear Algebra: Introduction to Vectors	Rn is the set of all of these possible ordered n-tuples or ordered sets of n numbers. So what is a vector? What is a vector in Rn? Well, a vector in Rn really is just a particular instance of one of these n-tuples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cWB52I-SF0#t=569.91s
Linear Algebra: Introduction to Vectors	But I'm going to define my vector. A vector as an Rn is an ordered list of n real numbers, and I define-- and this is an example. So it would be v1, v2, all the way to vn, where each of these is a member of the real numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cWB52I-SF0#t=635.0s
Defining the angle between vectors | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the triangle-- the vector triangle inequality to prove that each of these sides is less than or equal to the sum of the other sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWob_z74Ks#t=255.56s
Defining the angle between vectors | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So we know that b is less than the length of those two things. So we don't have to worry about that one right there. Finally, a minus b. The magnitude or the length of vector a minus b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWob_z74Ks#t=496.45s
Defining the angle between vectors | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	We're defining perpendicular to mean the theta between-- two vectors a and b are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90 degrees.

Showing that inverses are linear | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	But T-inverse maps from this set to that set. Let's write it up here. T-inverse is a mapping from your codomain to your domain. Although it looks identical, just like that. OK, so what is this going to be equal to? Well we just said, by definition of your inverse transformation, this is going to be equal to the identity transformation on your codomain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr9Tow8hpCg#t=307.58s
Showing that inverses are linear | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	Well what is a composition? We know that T, if we take-- let me put it this way. We know that T of x is equal to Ax. So if we write T-inverse, the composition of T-inverse with T applied to some vector x is going to be equal to first, A being applied to x is going to be equal to Ax, this a right here, Ax.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr9Tow8hpCg#t=1104.71s
Showing that inverses are linear | Matrix transformations | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	A-inverse, or the matrix transformation for T-inverse, when you multiply that with the matrix transformation for T, you're going to get the identity matrix. And the argument actually holds both ways. So we know this is true, but the other definition of an inverse, or invertibility, told us that the composition of T with T-inverse is equal to the identity transformation in our codomain, which is also Rn.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr9Tow8hpCg#t=1187.46s
Orthogonal complements | Alternate coordinate systems (bases) | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	So we're essentially saying, look, you have some subspace, it's got a bunch of vectors in it. Now if I can find some other set of vectors where every member of that set is orthogonal to every member of the subspace in question, then the set of those vectors is called the orthogonal complement of V.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOTjdgmNqlg#t=77.23s
Null space 2: Calculating the null space of a matrix |  Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	In this case, we'll calculate the null space of matrix A.

Null space 2: Calculating the null space of a matrix |  Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	This is a member of R4. It has four components. And then when you multiply these, we need to produce a 0 vector. The null space is the set of all the vectors, and when I multiply it times A, I produce the 0 vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvyboGryeA8#t=56.44s
Null space 2: Calculating the null space of a matrix |  Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	The null space of A is the set of all vectors that are a member of -- we generally say Rn, but this is a 3 by 4 matrix, so these are all the vectors that are going to be members of R4, because I'm using this particular A, such that my matrix A times any of these vectors is equal to the 0 vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvyboGryeA8#t=91.37s
Matrices: Reduced row echelon form 1 | Vectors and spaces | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy	x1 and x3 are pivot variables.

Inequality word problem: one variable | Applying mathematical reasoning | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	So they say the Karman line is the point at which the Earth's atmosphere ends and outer space begins. So what if we're right at 62 miles? The Karman line is 62 miles above sea level, and any distance from sea level at the Karman line or above is considered outer space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aINeMQH77jg#t=58.82s

Reading bar charts: putting it together with central tendency | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	Daniel got a 60. And so the midrange is going to be the mean, the arithmetic mean of these two numbers. So you add 100 plus 60, divide by 2, you get 160 over 2, or 80.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGZNaKnbQo0#t=146.35s
Hexadecimal number system | Applying mathematical reasoning | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	- [Voiceover] We're all familiar with the base 10 number system, were often called the decimal number system, where we have 10 digits Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EJay-6Bioo#t=0.649s
Hexadecimal number system | Applying mathematical reasoning | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	Now, we started to see that we can have alternate number system.

Old separable differential equations introduction | Khan Academy	This is, let's see, negative 1 squared, that's 1. Minus 2 times minus 1, that's plus 2, is equal to c. And we get c is equal to 3. So, the implicit exact solution, the solution of our differential equation-- remember now, it's not a class, because they gave us an initial condition-- is y squared minus 2y is equal to x to the third plus 2x squared plus 2x plus 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5-lz0hcqsE#t=549.28s
Exact equations example 1 | First order differential equations | Khan Academy	So let's say I have the differential, y, the differential equation, y cosine of x, plus 2xe to the y, plus sine of x, plus-- I'm already running out of space-- x squared, e to the y, minus 1, times y prime, is equal to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb04ntcDJcQ#t=12.195s
Laplace transform 2 | Laplace transform | Differential Equations | Khan Academy	So we don't get an answer. And when you do improper integrals, when you take the limit to infinity and it doesn't come to a finite number, the limit doesn't approach anything, that means that k the improper integral diverges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33TYoybjqPg#t=205.25s
2nd order linear homogeneous differential equations 2 | Khan Academy	So we know, if we want to solve for r, that this, r squared plus 5r, plus 6, that has to be 0.

What is a differential equation	What is a differential equation? Well, a differential equation is an equation that involves an unknown function and its derivatives. So what do I mean by that? Well, let's say that I said that y prime plus y is equal to x plus 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_POEWfygmU#t=49.73s
What is a differential equation	An ordinary differential equation is what I wrote down. It's one variable with respect to another variable, or one function with respect you to, say, x and its derivatives.

Recognizing prime and composite numbers | Factors and multiples | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	So it only has 1 and itself. A composite number is a natural number that has more than just 1 and itself as factors. And we'll see examples of that and neither-- we'll see an interesting case of that in this problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4UK62Qrbo#t=41.22s
Least common multiple exercise: 3 numbers | Factors and multiples | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	And the least common multiple is the number that has all of the elements of the prime factorizations of these and nothing else. So let me show you what I mean by that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6yHKOYJiso#t=181.67s
Greatest common factor explained | Factors and multiples | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	And I'll throw out some terminology here for you. When two numbers have a greatest common factor of only 1, they're called relatively prime. And that kind of makes sense because a prime number is something that only has 1 and itself as a factor.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFd-6EPfnec#t=268.76s
Greatest common factor explained | Factors and multiples | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	And two relatively prime numbers are numbers that only have 1 as their greatest common factor.

Prime factorization | Factors and multiples | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	And we could keep going on like this. People have written computer programs looking for the highest prime and all of that. So now that we know what a prime is, a prime factorization is breaking up a number, like 75, into a product of prime numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKKDTfHcsG0#t=88.24s
Common divisibility examples | Factors and multiples | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	So let's take the prime factorization, the prime factorization of 12, let's see, 12 is 2 times 6. 6 isn't prime yet so 6 is 2 times 3. So that is prime.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWcfVC-oCNw#t=26.505s
Adding, subtracting numbers in different formats | Decimals | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	We'll get a positive number, a larger positive number than what we're going to subtract from it right over here.

Significant figures | Decimals | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy	Let's see if we can learn a thing or two about significant figures, sometimes called significant digits. And the idea behind significant figures is just to make sure that when you do a big computation and you have a bunch of digits there, that you're not over-representing the amount of precision that you had, that the result isn't more precise than the things that you actually measured, that you used to get that result.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJ76hz7jPM#t=0.094s
More examples of addition and subtraction of polynomials | Algebra II | Khan Academy	So it's good to know what we're talking about. The standard form of a polynomial, essentially just list the terms in order of degree. So this is in a non-standard form. If I were to list this polynomial in standard form, I would put this term first. So I would write 7x to the fifth, then what's the next smallest degree? Well, they have this x squared term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgFXL6SEUiI#t=321.89s
Example 2: Adding polynomials | Algebra I | Khan Academy	We're asked to simplify 5x squared plus 8x minus 3 plus 2x squared minus 7x plus 13x. So really, all we have to do is we have to combine like terms-- terms that have x raised to the same power.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahdKdxsTj8E#t=0.53s
Example 2: Factor a quadratic binomial with two variables by taking a common factor | Khan Academy	We're asked to factor 20u squared v minus 10uv squared. And when they say factor a binomial like this, an expression that has two terms like this, they really mean break it up into the product of one or more terms. So let's see if we can do that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=499MvHFrqUU#t=0.63s
Example 2: Modeling with polynomials | Algebra I | Khan Academy	Polynomial just means that we have multiple terms here and this is three terms. We could even call it a trinomial. Polynomial is a more general term for more than one term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs7IB48Fvg#t=73.24s

Basic geometry: language and labels | Introduction to Euclidean geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	So if you took a piece of paper that extended forever, it just extended in every direction forever, that in a geometrical sense was a plane. The piece of paper itself, the thing that's finite, and you'll never see this talked about in a typical geometry class, but I guess if we were to draw the analogy, you could call a piece of paper maybe a plane segment, because it's a segment of an entire plane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0EJrY64qE#t=724.05s

Language and notation of the circle | Introduction to Euclidean geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	My best attempt. And this set of all of the points that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A, this is a circle, as I'm sure you are already familiar with. But that is the formal definition-- the set of all points that are a fixed distance, or that have a fixed distance, from A that are a given distance from A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2W7HPyC0cM#t=96.66s
Language and notation of the circle | Introduction to Euclidean geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	AB connects the center and it connects a point on the circle itself. Remember, the circle itself is all of the points that are equal distance from the center. So AB, any line segment, I should say, that connects the center to a point on the circle, we would call a radius.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2W7HPyC0cM#t=161.51s
Language and notation of the circle | Introduction to Euclidean geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	So this circle with a dot in the middle tells we're talking about a circle, and this is a circle centered at point A.

Quadrilateral properties | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	And this is definitely a closed shape that has four sides. So it is definitely a quadrilateral. Next, we have to think about whether it is a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral that has two pairs of parallel sides, where in each pair they're opposite sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CeBlu260Rw#t=13.55s
Quadrilateral properties | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	So this is definitely also a parallelogram. Next, we ask about a trapezoid. Now, trapezoid is interesting.

Quadrilateral properties | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	And if we used that definition, then we would call it a trapezoid. So it really depends on the definition that you're using. Now, let's go on to rhombus. So a rhombus is a quadrilateral where four of the sides are congruent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CeBlu260Rw#t=175.61s
Two column proof showing segments are perpendicular | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	Angle DEC and angle BEC are supplementary. They are supplementary, and that's kind of-- you can just look at that from inspection but I'll write a decent-- are supplementary. Supplementary, which means they add up, their measures add up, to 180 degrees.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu1LKnhM5Q#t=463.66s
Law of cosines for star distance | Trig identities and examples | Trigonometry | Khan Academy	Voiceover:Artemis seeks knowledge of the width of Orion's belt, which is a pattern of stars in the Orion constellation. She has previously discovered the distances from her house to Alnitak, 736 lights years, and to Mintaka, 915 light years, which are the endpoints of Orion's belt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kGi1dvGZNY#t=1.143s
Law of cosines for star distance | Trig identities and examples | Trigonometry | Khan Academy	So it would take light 915 years to get from her house to Mintaka, or from Mintaka to her house. So this is 915 light years. And what we wanna do is figure out the width of Orion's belt, which is the distance between Alnitak and Mintaka.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kGi1dvGZNY#t=114.674s
Complementary and supplementary angles | Angles and intersecting lines | Geometry | Khan Academy	"And when you have two angles like this that share the same side, these are called adjacent angles. Because the word ""adjacent"" literally means next to. These are adjacent. They are adjacent angles."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTnAlNSgNsY#t=71.32s
Area of a trapezoid | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	So right here, we have a four-sided figure, or a quadrilateral, where two of the sides are parallel to each other.

And what we want to do is, given the dimensions that they've given us, what is the area of this trapezoid.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3-XYLnxJDY#t=0.83s
Constructing a tangent line using compass and straightedge | Geometry | Khan Academy	You'd be amazed at the things you can draw or construct if you have a straightedge and a compass. A straightedge is literally just something that has a straight edge that allows you to draw straight lines, like a ruler.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5cKWjZqpIE#t=0.3s
Constructing a tangent line using compass and straightedge | Geometry | Khan Academy	A compass is something that allows you to draw circles centered where you want them to be centered of different radii.

Congruent legs and base angles of isosceles triangles | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	So what I want to prove here is that these two-- and they're sometimes referred to as base angles, these angles that are between one of the sides, and the side that isn't necessarily equal to it, and the other side that is equal and the side that's not equal to it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UISwx2Mr4c#t=40.04s
Congruent legs and base angles of isosceles triangles | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	If you have an isosceles triangle, a triangle where two of the sides are congruent, then their base angles, these base angles, are also going to be congruent. Now let's think about it the other way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UISwx2Mr4c#t=227.79s
Parallel lines from equation | Mathematics I | High School Math | Khan Academy	We are asked which of these lines are parallel. So parallel lines are lines that have the same slope, and they're different lines, so they never, ever intersect. So we need to look for different lines that have the exact same slope.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-aCweuimis#t=0.58s
Pythagorean theorem 3 | Right triangles and trigonometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	The side opposite the right angle, or the 90 degrees, is a hypotenuse, or the longest side. It is the square root of 74. And the shorter sides are w and 7.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0IOrRETWhI#t=70.05s
Another example using compass and straightedge for tangent line | Geometry | Khan Academy	Well what am I talking about? Let me actually just draw the triangle. So let me add a straight edge here. So I'm gonna draw a triangle, so it has one side as the diameter, so we're gonna embed it in this circle that I just constructed, this circle centered at this midpoint, this circle right over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_dStt4st2I#t=214.17s

Nets of polyhedra | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	Polyhedron is when you have one of them. This is a polyhedron. A rectangular pyramid is a polyhedron. So let me draw that. I'll make this one a little bit more transparent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZACf9EecFrY#t=35.59s
Circles: radius, diameter, circumference and Pi | Geometry | Khan Academy	The circle just keeps showing up over and over and over again. So it's probably worthwhile for us to understand some of the properties of the circle. So the first thing when people kind of discovered the circle, and you just have a look at the moon to see a circle, but the first time they said well, what are the properties of any circle? So the first one they might want to say is well, a circle is all of the points that are equal distant from the center of the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyLRpr2P0MQ#t=12.84s
Circles: radius, diameter, circumference and Pi | Geometry | Khan Academy	All of these points along the edge are equal distant from that center right there.

Right there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyLRpr2P0MQ#t=40.44s
Perimeter and area: the basics | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	And you're probably pretty familiar with these concepts, but we'll revisit it just in case you are not.

Area of a circle intuition | High School Geometry | High School Math | Khan Academy	Now, we have the circumference formula right here, once again, this comes out of the definition of Pi, but from this, I'd like to at least get an intuitive feel for why the area formula is given by Pi r squared and to think about that, we're going to approximate the area of polygons, the areas of polygons, that are inscribed in a circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2L27dTOyHk#t=59.317s
Quadrilaterals: find the type exercise | Quadrilaterals | Geometry | Khan Academy	They have trapezoid and isosceles trapezoid.

Solving inscribed quadrilaterals | Mathematics II | High School Math | Khan Academy	So, it looks like at least for this case that these angles, these opposite angles of this inscribed quadrilateral, it looks like they are supplementary. So, an interesting question is are they always going to be supplementary? If you have a quadrilateral, an arbitrary quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, so each of the vertices of the quadrilateral sit on the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9cznjBl0Hk#t=240.646s
Identifying parallel and perpendicular lines | Geometry | Khan Academy	Line ST is parallel to line UV. And I think that's the only set of parallel lines in this diagram. Yep.

Classifying a quadrilateral on the coordinate plane | Analytic geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	So this isn't even a parallelogram. This isn't even a trapezoid. Parallelogram, you have to have two pairs of parallel sides. Trapezoid, you have to have one pair of parallel sides. This isn't the case for any of these, or none of these sides are parallel.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsgrWDLEzcQ#t=291.41s
Quadrilateral overview | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	So one type of convex quadrilateral is a trapezoid. And a trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral, and sometimes the definition here is a little bit-- different people will use different definitions. So some people will say a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has exactly two sides that are parallel to each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka82QC4QvGA#t=181.51s
Quadrilateral overview | Perimeter, area, and volume | Geometry | Khan Academy	But maybe we'll prove it in a separate video. But this right over here we would call a rectangle.

Now, if we have a parallelogram where we don't necessarily have four right angles, but where we do have the length of the sides being equal, then we're dealing with a rhombus.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka82QC4QvGA#t=372.23s
Radius and center for a circle equation in standard form | Algebra II | Khan Academy	You have some point, let's call that h, k.

Euclid as the father of geometry | Introduction to Euclidean geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	So he started with basic assumptions and those basic assumptions in geometric speak are called axioms or postulates. And from them, he proved, he deduced other statements or propositions. Or these are sometimes called theorems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqzK3UAXaHs#t=214.97s
Similarity postulates | Similarity | Geometry | Khan Academy	Side-side-side, when we're talking about congruence, means that the corresponding sides are congruent. Side-side-side for similarity, we're saying that the ratio between corresponding sides are going to be the same. So for example, let's say this right over here is 10.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bO0TmJ6Ba4#t=275.44s
More on why SSA is not a postulate | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	If I have a triangle that looks something-- I have trouble drawing straight triangles.

Measure of circumscribed angle | Circles | Geometry | Khan Academy	Angle A is a circumscribed angle on circle O. So this is angle A right over here. Then when they say it's a circumscribed angle, that means that the two sides of the angle are tangent to the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiqHJwzv_HI#t=0.86s
Congruent triangles and SSS | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	Things that we just will assume. We won't prove them. We will start with these assumptions, and then we're just going to build up from there. And one of the core ones that we'll see in geometry is the axiom, or the postulate, that if all the sides are congruent, or if the lengths of all the sides of the triangle are congruent, then we are dealing with congruent triangles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJrVOf_3dN0#t=420.55s
Parallel and perpendicular lines intro | Analytic geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	Actually I'm misspelling it-- perpendicular lines, and the idea of parallel lines.

What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	"That is called the range of the function. So the range. The range, and the most typical, there's actually a couple of definitions for range, but the most typical definition for range is ""the set of all possible outputs."" So you give me, you input something from the domain, it's going to output something, and by definition, because we have outputted it from this function, that thing is going to be in the range, and if we take the set of all of the things that the function could output, that is going to make up the range."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96uHMcHWD2E#t=76.591s

More examples of addition and subtraction of polynomials | Algebra II | Khan Academy	So it's good to know what we're talking about. The standard form of a polynomial, essentially just list the terms in order of degree. So this is in a non-standard form.

The middle is the number that is greater than two of the numbers and is less than two of the numbers. It's exactly in the middle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8EYEJ32oQ8#t=425.42s
What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	A domain is the set of all of the inputs over which the function is defined. So if this the domain here, if this is the domain here, and I take a value here, and I put that in for x, then the function is going to output an f(x).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96uHMcHWD2E#t=29.921s
What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	"That is called the range of the function. So the range. The range, and the most typical, there's actually a couple of definitions for range, but the most typical definition for range is ""the set of all possible outputs."" So you give me, you input something from the domain, it's going to output something, and by definition, because we have outputted it from this function, that thing is going to be in the range, and if we take the set of all of the things that the function could output, that is going to make up the range."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96uHMcHWD2E#t=76.591s
What is the range of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	The domain is the set of all valid inputs. So what are the valid inputs here? Well, I could take any real number and input into this, and I could take any real number and I can square it, there's nothing wrong with that, and so the domain is all real numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96uHMcHWD2E#t=146.988s
Interpreting the y-intercept of a graph in context | Algebra II | Khan Academy	The y-intercept is the value of y, the height when x is equal to 0. So that is indeed the significance of the y-intercept. Let's look at these other things. Mr. Theisen is shooting the basketball from 26 feet away.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3PTPN7NH8M#t=175.29s
Constructing a box and whisker plot | Probability and Statistics | Khan Academy	So how many data points do we have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. So the middle number is going to be a number that has 8 numbers larger than it and 8 numbers smaller than it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Cx7xuIXig#t=161.162s
Explicit and recursive definitions of sequences | Precalculus | Khan Academy	And you don't always have to add the same thing. We'll explore fancier sequences. The sequences where you keep adding the same amount, we call these arithmetic sequences, which we will also explore in more detail.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRFiAlo7t1E#t=43.18s
Explicit and recursive definitions of sequences | Precalculus | Khan Academy	But many can, including this, which is an arithmetic sequence, where we keep adding the same quantity over and over again. So how would we do that? Well, we could also-- another way of defining this first sequence, we could say a sub k, starting at k equals 1 and going to 4 with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRFiAlo7t1E#t=352.95s
Congruent legs and base angles of isosceles triangles | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	So what I want to prove here is that these two-- and they're sometimes referred to as base angles, these angles that are between one of the sides, and the side that isn't necessarily equal to it, and the other side that is equal and the side that's not equal to it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UISwx2Mr4c#t=40.04s
Congruent legs and base angles of isosceles triangles | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	If you have an isosceles triangle, a triangle where two of the sides are congruent, then their base angles, these base angles, are also going to be congruent. Now let's think about it the other way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UISwx2Mr4c#t=227.79s
Parallel lines from equation | Mathematics I | High School Math | Khan Academy	We are asked which of these lines are parallel. So parallel lines are lines that have the same slope, and they're different lines, so they never, ever intersect. So we need to look for different lines that have the exact same slope.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-aCweuimis#t=0.58s
Worked example: equivalent systems of equations | High School Math | Khan Academy	Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to the teacher's system? So the first question we should ask ourselves is what does it mean to even have an equivalent system? For the sake of this question, or for our purposes, an equivalent system is a system that has the same solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XstL_x4ucm4#t=14.552s
Analyzing graphs of exponential functions: negative initial value | High School Math | Khan Academy	Now to figure out the common ratio, there's a couple of ways you could think about it. The common ratio is the ratio between two successive values that are separated by one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No1LKevjF6U#t=117.922s
Compound inequalities | Linear inequalities | Algebra I | Khan Academy	Let's do some compound inequality problems, and these are just inequality problems that have more than one set of constraints. You're going to see what I'm talking about in a second. So the first problem I have is negative 5 is less than or equal to x minus 4, which is also less than or equal to 13.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3xPhzs-KBI#t=0.41s
Equilateral triangle sides and angles congruent | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	What we've got over here is a triangle where all three sides have the same length, or all three sides are congruent to each other. And a triangle like this we call equilateral.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYNUwiUzlPk#t=0.57s
Introduction to intercepts |  Algebra I | Khan Academy	Let me see. It's going to go through those two points and so it's going to look something like that. Now what are its' x and y-intercepts? Well, we already kind of figured it out but the intercepts themselves, these are the points on the graph where they intersect the axes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSB0N6esPU#t=344.126s
What is the domain of a function? | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	So this gets to the essence of what domain is. Domain is the set of all inputs over which the function is defined. So the domain of this function f would be all real numbers except for x equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DTMakGDZAw#t=102.06s
System of equations word problem: no solution | Mathematics I | High School Math | Khan Academy	- [Voiceover] A factory has machines that produce toys, which are then packed by the factory's workers. One day, each machine produced 14 toys and each worker packed two toys, so that a total of 40 toys remained unpacked.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRn3WhhS6vs#t=0.629s
How to determine the domain of a modeling function (example with a function) | Khan Academy	The domain of a function, that's a set of all the inputs for which the function is defined. And the inputs here, this is t and it represents days and if I input t, the number of days, into the function h, it'll output the height of the plant. So let's think about it. At first, you might say, in terms of, 0 days, 1 days, 2 days, and you might be tempted to say integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnQEaNTd08#t=30.26s
Slope from two ordered pairs example 1 | Algebra I | Khan Academy	Our change in x was this value, our endpoint, our end x-value minus our starting x-value. Let's do the same thing for our change in y. Our change in y. If we're starting at 2 and we go to 16, that means we moved up 14.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkspBxrzuZo#t=150.11s
Introduction to slope | Algebra I | Khan Academy	It could have a steep slope or a shallow slope. So slope is a measure for how steep something is. And the convention is, is we measure the increase in vertical for a given in increase in horizontal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeU-KzdCBps#t=204.201s
How to determine the domain of a modeling function | Functions | Algebra I | Khan Academy	Which number type is more appropriate for the domain of the function? So just to remind ourselves, what is the domain of a function? A domain is a set of all inputs over which the function is defined.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiW7syKXfJM#t=23.939s
Classifying a quadrilateral on the coordinate plane | Analytic geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	So this isn't even a parallelogram. This isn't even a trapezoid. Parallelogram, you have to have two pairs of parallel sides. Trapezoid, you have to have one pair of parallel sides. This isn't the case for any of these, or none of these sides are parallel.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsgrWDLEzcQ#t=291.41s
Understanding linear and exponential models | Functions and their graphs | Algebra II | Khan Academy	Voiceover:A newborn calf weighs 40 kilograms. Each week its weight increases by 5%. Let W be the weight in kilograms of the calf after t weeks. Is W a linear function or an exponential function? So, if W were a linear function, that means that every week that goes by, the weight would increase by the same amount.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OHEgD6YMBw#t=0.7s
Introduction to geometric sequences | Sequences, series and induction | Precalculus | Khan Academy	This is a sequence of numbers. It's not a geometric sequence, but it is a sequence. A geometric sequence is a special progression, or a special sequence, of numbers, where each successive number is a fixed multiple of the number before it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXo0bG4iAyg#t=34.57s
Introduction to geometric sequences | Sequences, series and induction | Precalculus | Khan Academy	Don't want to make a mistake here. These are sequences. You might also see the word a series. And you might even see a geometric series. A series, the most conventional use of the word series, means a sum of a sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXo0bG4iAyg#t=195.55s
More on why SSA is not a postulate | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	If I have a triangle that looks something-- I have trouble drawing straight triangles. So let's say the triangle looks something like that. And let's say that we've found another triangle that has a congruent side, a side that is congruent to this side right over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8svAm237xM#t=31.065s
Congruent triangles and SSS | Congruence | Geometry | Khan Academy	Things that we just will assume. We won't prove them. We will start with these assumptions, and then we're just going to build up from there. And one of the core ones that we'll see in geometry is the axiom, or the postulate, that if all the sides are congruent, or if the lengths of all the sides of the triangle are congruent, then we are dealing with congruent triangles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJrVOf_3dN0#t=420.55s
Parallel and perpendicular lines intro | Analytic geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy	Actually I'm misspelling it-- perpendicular lines, and the idea of parallel lines. So perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at a right angle. So what am I talking about? So let's say that this is one line right over here and that this is another line right over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xounKGEXs#t=12.47s
9. Reducibility	So as you recall from last time, we had this problem HALT TM, which is the problem of testing for a given Turing machine and an input to that Turing machine, whether the Turing machine halts, either accepting or rejecting, but just whether it halts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=218.83s
9. Reducibility	OK, so the concept of reducibility is that we say one problem is reducible to another, say A reducible to B. It means that you can use B to solve A. That's what it means for A to be reducible to B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=530.05s
9. Reducibility	But from your homework, we had this pusher problem, the problem of determining whether a pushdown automaton ever pushes on its stack for any input. I know a bunch of you were struggling with that problem working on it, hopefully solving it in one way or another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=708.41s
9. Reducibility	They are all equivalent. And now we're going to use this notion of a function that you can compute to define a kind of reducibility called mapping reducibility. I'm going to say that A is mapping reducible to B, written with this less than or equal to sub M symbol.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=2242.15s
9. Reducibility	And you think of you're trying to solve A. You're trying to decide membership in A. So you want to test whether w is in A or not. A mapping reducible is a function which maps things from this space over to that space in a way that strings that are in A get mapped to strings that are in B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=2299.14s
9. Reducibility	And for that reason, it's not always going to be useful to prove Turing unrecognizability. It's better for proving undecidability. So what we're calling reducibility, or general reducibility is where we just use a solvent for B to solve A in sort of a most general possible way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=3274.09s
9. Reducibility	And the thing that's going to do the trick is going to be that same reduction function that we saw earlier. We're going to take that machine w from before, the machine that filters out all the non-w's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=3969.65s
9. Reducibility	So these are two different f's. I'm going to make f here. Instead of generating Tw and T reject, I'm going to have Tw and T accept which is a Turing machine that always accepts its input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=4269.91s
10. Computation History Method	Good. All right. So why don't we continue. Now, we're all ready to start defining computation histories, which themselves are not very difficult concept. Computation history for a Turing machine M on an input w is just the sequence of configurations you go through.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGqoLm2aAgc#t=1358.47s
10. Computation History Method	That's what we mean by a computation history, or sometimes we're going to emphasize that by calling it an accepting computation history. Represent meaning that the machine has accepted its input, and these are the sequence of configurations that the machine goes through.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGqoLm2aAgc#t=1420.71s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	A Turing machine can recognize a language, the collection of old strings that it accepts. And if the Turing machine always halts, we say it decides the language, and it's a decider, and so therefore, that language is a decided language, a Turing decider.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=242.65s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	That's going to be a decidable language too. And now we have Turing machine A-- DANFA, the decider for ANFA that decides ANFA. OK? So now, as promised, here's our new form for writing our Turing machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=1044.099s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	And EDFA is the DFAs that have empty language, so I should be accepting those. If there's no way to get to an accept state, no accept state is marked. And reject if some accept state earmark, because then the language is not empty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=1693.2s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	I'm going to prove it in an entirely different way, which doesn't require any analysis at all-- no proving something about balance. I'm going to take advantage of something we've already shown, which is I'm going to make a new finite automaton, a new DFAC built out of A and B, which accepts all the strings on which A and B disagree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=1991.255s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	So I'm going to make a machine, a DFAC where the language of C is exactly that symmetric difference. It's all the strings in A intersected with the strings that are not in B-- so in A and not in B-- or in B and not-- then not an A-- take the union of those two parts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=2079.139s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	And so I'll help you through that. Remember-- you should remember, but you may not have looked at it-- something called Chomsky normal form, which is for context-free grammars, but only allows the rules to be of a special kind.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=2600.18s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	Now we're going to use that to prove a corollary, which is important for understanding how everything fits together. And that corollary states that every context-free language is a decidable language. Every context-free language is decidable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=2844.33s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	We've been looking at finite automata and regular languages. Those are the languages that finite automata can recognize. And we talked about nondeterminism. So we had non-deterministic finite automata and deterministic finite automata.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=42.57s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	We showed that they're equivalent. We looked at the closure properties over the regular operations union, concatenation, and star, and showed that the regular language is really-- the class of regular languages is closed under those regular operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=59.76s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	So this is going to be a nondeterministic machine. There might be several different ways of processing the input. And if any one of them gets to an accepting state at the end of the input, we say the GNFA accepts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=551.93s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	So if you take the language B, where these are strings-- well, let's assume our alphabet is zeros and ones. B is the language of all strings that have an equal number of zeros and ones.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=2040.48s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	And so now we know that the string-- the language 0 star 1 star is a regular language, because it's described by a regular expression. If you take the B, which is the equal numbers of zeros and ones, and you intersect it with 0 star 1 star, that's going to be a regular language if B was regular, using closure under intersection.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=3547.17s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	But this language B intersect 0 star 1 star is the language of equal numbers of zeros and ones where the zeros come first. And that's the language D that we showed two slides back, that we already know can't be regular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=3571.74s
26. coNP is a subset of IP	Let me hold off on that for now what the degree is. I'll answer the questions in a second. So now remember from before, number phi was the number of satisfying assignments when I preset the first i values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEXSv0jChO4#t=2015.18s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	And so, the one-tape Turing machine is a reasonable choice. Given that, we defined time complexity classes, the TIME[T(n)] classes. We defined the class P, which was invariant among all of those different deterministic models in the sense that it didn't matter which model we choose, we were going to end up with the same class P. So that argues for its naturalness.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=112.69s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	So with that, let's move into today's content, which is, well, just a quick review. As I mentioned, we defined the time complexity class. The time complexity class is a collection of all of the languages that you can solve in a certain time bound, within a certain amount of time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=181.08s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	So the time n-squared, for example, is all of the languages or all of the problems that you can solve in n-squared time. We're identifying problems with languages here. And the class P is the collection of all problems that you can solve or all languages that you can solve in polynomial time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=211.95s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	So now we're going to define the analogous complexity class associated to non-deterministic computation, which we'll call non-deterministic time. So non-deterministic time T of n is the set of all languages that you can do with a non-deterministic machine that runs in order T of n time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=586.18s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	And by analogy with what we did before, the class NP is the collection of all languages that you can do non-deterministically in polynomial time. So it's the union over all of the ntime classes where the bound is polynomial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=685.15s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	And we'll return now to this notion of NP corresponding to easy verifiability. NP are the languages where you can easily verify membership quickly. I'll try to explain what that means. In contrast, P are the languages where you can test membership quickly.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=1768.75s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	That's not going to be relevant for us. So let's not think about that. How does a Turing machine perform division? How does a Turing machine perform division? Well, how do you perform division? [LAUGHS] Long division is an operation that can run in-- the long division procedure that you learn in grade school, you can implement that on a Turing machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=2359.935s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	Since I've spent some time thinking-- I'm known as having spent some time thinking about it. People claim to solve the problem, solve P is NP, the P versus NP problem, by basically saying, problems like Hamiltonian path or other similar problems, basically there's clearly no way to solve them without searching through a lot of possibilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=2662.55s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	Not memorization. Came from the same root, I think, but memoization, which is somehow remembering the results of a computation so you don't have to repeat it. The total number of calls is going to be, at most, n squared, to this algorithm, because you're never going to be redoing work that you've done already.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=3500.9s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	I'm assuming that you've all seen Boolean algebra, Boolean arithmetic before, where the and operation is only true if both inputs are true. These are going to be binary and operations and binary or operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=4136.649s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	But with the right definition, the answer is yes. So you can define a verifier as a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate, that takes a certificate and an input to the language, and will accept if that certificate is a valid certificate for that input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=4625.18s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	One of those variables is going to be a computation history-- an integer which represents the computation history for m on W. And the other variables are there to help you kind of decode that so that the polynomial can actually check and make a solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=129.6s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	What do we mean by that? I mean a machine-- I'm going to call it SELF-- which ignores its input. So on any input, you turn it on, the machine grinds around for a while, and halts with a description of itself on the tape-- with the description of SELF, its own code, sitting on the tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=592.36s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	It sees some string on the tape. A is the machine that prints out that string. A is q of this string. So B is simply going to compute q of whatever it sees on the tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=1018.05s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	In the Turing machine, which is the action and which is the template, and in the sentence, which is the action and which is the template. The action is the part where there's some interesting sort of instructional stuff happening that you have to carry out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=1613.623s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	And so remember, enumerators, you can enumerate exactly all the recognizable languages. So I'm going to assume I have an enumerator for this language, which just prints out all of the minimal Turing machines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=3066.12s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	OK, mathematical logic is the mathematical study of mathematics itself. Godel's first incompleteness theorem, as we described, is that in any reasonable formal system of mathematical provability, there are going to be some true statements that are not provable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=3805.24s
15. NP-Completeness	So in the direction of exploring this question and its ramifications, we introduced this problem called SAT. These are the Boolean formulas, which have an assignment that makes them evaluate to true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=256.22s
15. NP-Completeness	So we take these clauses, which themselves are ORs-- we and them together, we get a formula that's conjunctive normal form. Conjunctive stands for and, I think. Conjunction is an and. And then a 3CNF is a CNF where each clause has exactly three literals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=600.63s
15. NP-Completeness	And a 3SAT problem-- so this is the first of the two problems we're going to be talking about-- the 3SAT problem is the satisfiability problem restricted to these 3CNF formulas. So this is the collection of-- set of 3CNF formulas which are satisfiable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=639.46s
15. NP-Completeness	So for that we-- going to turn to graph theory. So we're going to consider graphs, points and lines-- connecting them. And we will say that a clique in a graph is a collection of nodes-- collection of the points that are all pairwise connected by lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=697.45s
15. NP-Completeness	And a k-clique is one where you have k such nodes. So here we have a three clique, four clique, and a five clique. And then the clique problem is to try to find cliques of a certain specified size embedded within a given graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=718.5s
15. NP-Completeness	Verifying means you can verify something if you're given a certificate. In the case of a clique-- the clique problem-- the certificate is the clique. So once you have the certificate, you can do the verification in polynomial time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=1070.92s
15. NP-Completeness	Obviously, satisfiability means that the-- you can find an assignment to the variables. So you're going to set each of these variables-- A, B, and C, and so on-- to true or false, and you want to make the whole formula evaluate the true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=1194.05s
15. NP-Completeness	k is the number of clauses exactly when phi was satisfied. It's kind of cool. If phi is satisfiability, then there will be a k-clique here. And if phi was not satisfiability-- no k-clique.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=1603.47s
15. NP-Completeness	And this is the way the global structure of G is going to look like. Now, I'm getting a question here. What do those horizontal nodes-- what role do they play? Those nodes are there to allow me to visit those clause nodes, the nodes which represent the clause gadgets, which I'm going to place over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4211.17s
15. NP-Completeness	These are spacers that separate the detours from one another, and that force a visit to the clause node to come back to the same place from which it left. Otherwise, you would never be able to visit those spacer nodes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4548.76s
15. NP-Completeness	These are the so-called clause gadgets, which are going to force there to be one true literal in every clause for the satisfying assignment. You have to look at it, or maybe we can spend a little bit more time explaining it, but that's what the purpose is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4632.04s
15. NP-Completeness	Is everything either NP complete or in P? So for one thing, there are problems that are not known to be in either category. So we'll discuss some of those in due course, but one of them is the graph isomorphism problem, testing two graphs-- if they're really just permutations of one another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4887.89s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	That would imply that an NP-complete problem would have that property. And so proving a problem being NP-complete is evidence, very strong evidence, that it doesn't have a polynomial time solution. And so therefore it's called intractable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=132.66s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	But I'm going to do it in the form of a check-in. So I'm sure you've all seen the big sum notation using a big sigma to represent a sum over some set of possibilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=310.99s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	This is not a sigma. This is a gamma. Gamma is the tape alphabet. This is any symbol, including an input symbol, from sigma is going to be in gamma. So this is any symbol can appear on the tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=1971.69s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	So let's look at what I mean by a legal neighborhood. So a legal neighborhood is a setting of the values, the six values of this 2 by 3 neighborhood, in a way which doesn't violate M's rules.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=3023.18s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	And that's going to be logically equivalent to saying that A implies B. Another logical equivalence may be more familiar to you. It's just simply De Morgan's law, which says that if you have the not of A AND B, that's equivalent to saying the not of A or the not of B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=4110.109s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	Logically equivalent means that it gives you exactly the same function. If you set the variables in the same way, you get the same result coming out. Well, phi prime has more variables than phi does.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=4524.78s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	I encourage you to think about that for a minute if not immediately obvious. But those are the strings that are going to be accepted by this machine. And we call that collection of strings the language of the machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=898.82s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	Sigma is the alphabet symbols of the automaton, another finite set. Delta is the transition function. That tells us how the automaton moves from state to state. Those describes how those transition arrows-- those arrows which connected the states with each other-- it describes them in a mathematical way instead in terms of a picture.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1219.89s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	And the way I'm doing that is with a function. So delta is a function which takes two things. So I'm hoping you've seen this notation before. I'll help you through it once, but this is the kind of thing I would expect you to have seen already.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1245.51s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	We're not going to talk about that. Maybe rarely, we'll make it very clear, we'll talk about an infinite string, but that's going to be an exception. And a language is a set of strings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1474.21s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	They're not even of the same type of object. So don't confuse them with one another. I mean, you can have a set, a language, which has just one element, which is the empty string.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1531.31s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	Like the union operation, for example, that's one you probably have seen before. The union of two languages here is a collection of strings that are in either one or the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2059.0s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	And the last of the regular operations is the so-called star operation, which is a unary operation. It applies to just a single language. And so what you do is now you're going to take-- to get a member of the star language, you're going to take a bunch of strings in the original language, A, you stick them together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2117.51s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	So this is something you're going to see frequently. Sigma star means this is the language of all strings over the alphabet we're working with at that moment. Now, if you take sigma star 1, you just concatenate 1 onto all of the elements of sigma star, and that's going to give you all strings that end with a 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2411.763s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	So sigma star 1 is all strings that end with 1. Or, for example, you take sigma star 11 sigma star, that is all strings that contain 11. And we already saw that language once before.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2450.79s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	Can we get empty string from empty set? Yeah. There are a bunch of exotic cases, by the way. So empty language star is the language which has just the empty string.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2587.14s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	So this is the collection of pairs of states, q1 and q2, where q1 is in the state of the first machine, q2 is the state of the second machine. The start state is you start at the two start states of the two machines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=3102.33s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	You just want to make sure that, when you're picking the repetition R, the two R's here, you pick the lowest possible repetitions that occur, if you have many choices. And those lowest two, those lowest repetitions, there is not going to be any lower repetition here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=1938.49s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	And so just to make sure we were on the same page on this, the language of the machine is the collection of strings that the machine accepts. So the things that are not in the language are the things that are rejected either by looping or by halting and rejecting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4000.87s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	So only the ones that are accepted is the language. Every machine has just a single language. It's the language of all strings that that machine accepts. And we'll say that and recognize that language, if that language is the collection of such strings that are accepted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4019.84s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	We'll say that, instead of just recognizing the language, we'll say that it decides the language. And the Turing-decidable language is a language that the machine-- of all strings the machine accepts for some Turing machine which is a decider, which is a Turing machine that always halts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4135.76s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	So we haven't shown this inclusion yet. But actually, this is the picture that we get. So there is actually a hierarchy of containments here. Regular languages are a subset of the context-free languages, which are, in turn, a subset of the decidable languages, which in turn, are a subset of the Turing-recognizable languages.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4237.18s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	And we defined Turing deciders, Turing machine deciders that halt on all inputs. OK, so I think, with that, we have come to the end of today's lecture. I will stick around a little bit and answer questions in the chat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4283.93s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	But because of the probabilistic nature of the machine, it might get the wrong answer on some branches. And so we say that a machine decides a language with a certain error probability, means that the probability of getting the wrong answer is going to be, at most, that error probability epsilon over all of the possible inputs to the machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=266.05s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	A typical way that people implement randomness in an algorithm is to use a pseudo random number generator, which is a procedure that might give you some kind of a value that looks random, but may not actually be random.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=482.37s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	And testing that is a coNP complete problem, as you're asked to show on your homework. Now, if the branching program, however, has a restriction, namely, that it's not allowed to ask to query the same variable more than once on a path, then with that restriction, we call it a read-once branching program.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=796.64s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	So by following the 1s, it's like the breadcrumbs in Hansel and Gretel. This is the path you need to follow to get through the machine. The 0s are the places where you don't go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=1090.95s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	All right. So let's continue. All right. So now, I'm going to talk about how we're going to extend this to the non-Boolean case, using the arithmetization method. So first of all, arithmetization is a simulation of and and or with plus and times, such that if I think about true as a 1 and false as a 0, this is going to give me a faithful simulation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=1340.64s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	All right, so let's continue. Good, all right. So now everybody's back, I hope? Let's talk about moving forward here. Where we're going with this is we want to analyze the algorithm, which picks a random non-Boolean input and evaluates the two branching programs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=3202.74s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] MICHAEL SIPSER: Welcome, everyone. Welcome back to theory of computation. And just to recap where we are, we have been looking at time complexity and space complexity. And we just finished proving what are called the hierarchy theorems, which, in a nutshell, basically say that, if you allow the computational model to have a little bit more resource, a little bit more time, a little bit more space, then you can do more things with certain conditions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=0.0s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	OK. So the time and space hierarchy theorems-- because we're going to be using those today-- they say that if you give a little bit more space here-- so for space constructible functions, functions that you can actually compute within the amount of space that they specify, you can show that the things that you can do in that much space is probably larger than what you can do in less space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=122.39s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	So a rejecting computation history is the sequence of configurations the machine goes through from the start configuration until it ends up at a configuration with a reject state, a rejecting configuration.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=1635.34s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	So we have a lot of Greek letters to play with, so we're going to use delta for the alphabet that we write the computation histories in. If you want to get reminded what that delta is, a computation history can have a tape alphabet symbol for M, it can have a state symbol for M, or it can have a delimiter pound-- hashtag.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=1740.622s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	Looks like this. So any string that doesn't start with these symbols, doesn't start exactly like this, should be described by bad start, that regular expression. So that, in itself, is going to be further subdivided.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=2456.52s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	Especially because they're going to tell us something interesting about methods, which may or may not be useful for proving the P versus NP question, when someday somebody hopefully does that. What is an oracle? An oracle is free information you're going to give to a Turing machine, which might affect the difficulty of solving problems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=3468.008s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	So that's what we-- the terminology that people usually use is sometimes called relativism, or computation relative to having this extra information. So P with an A oracle is all of the language that you can decide in polynomial time if you have an oracle for A. Let's see.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=3639.02s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	But now that I have the SAT oracle, it's going to make it possible where before it was not possible. So let's just understand what I mean by that. If I'm trying to do the non minimal formulas, namely the formulas that do have a shorter equivalent formula.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=3840.71s
18. PSPACE-Completeness	So getting back to what we've been doing. We've been talking about space complexity. Measures how much memory the algorithm requires or various problems require. And we defined the space complexity classes, space f of n and non-deterministic space f of n, the polynomial space and non-deterministic space classes, and gave some examples and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVv9WXwW95w#t=41.28s
18. PSPACE-Completeness	And let's just try to be clear on the algorithm to solve the ladder DFA problem. So if you remember, first of all, let me just jump on ahead. The ladder problem is-- a ladder, first of all, is a sequence of strings that change one symbol at a time that perhaps connect, go from one string to another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVv9WXwW95w#t=352.29s
18. PSPACE-Completeness	So it's going to be log t levels before we get down to 1. Yeah. So somebody is asking, can we think of this as a memory stack? Yes, this is like-- that's the way your typical implementation of recursion is kind of with a stack, where you push when you make a call and you pop when you return from the call.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVv9WXwW95w#t=1355.2s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	One was about the ladder problem, where you're trying to see if you can get from one string to another string changing one symbol at a time. And all of the strings were in the language of some finite automaton, or you had some reasonable rule for saying which are the valid strings, which are not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=51.76s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	And then we built on that idea. We showed Savitch's theorem, that going from any nondeterministic machine to a deterministic machine only squares the amount of space. And then we finally proved that TQBF, this problem about quantified Boolean formulas, testing whether they are true, that that problem is complete for PSPACE.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=73.09s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	"But a forced win is also called a ""winning strategy."" That just means that if both sides play optimally, they play the best possible-- not of their capability, I mean absolutely the best possible play-- then that Player I would still win."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=509.82s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	I'm not sure what else, what other why I can answer there. I'm going to answer some of the most basic questions here. Somebody is asking, how do we know how many variables to use? So the variables are the variables of the formula.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=1737.22s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	So if you take this formula here-- this is some particular formula, Exist x for all y, blah, blah, blah. There's going to be associated to that formula, a formula game where first Exist moves, assigns a value for x, and depending upon that value, For All is going to move and is going to assign a value for y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=1948.87s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	So log space are the things that you can do when you only have enough space to write down, essentially, a pointer or some fixed number of pointers into the input. That's what you get when you have logarithmic space, because log space is enough to write down an index of something.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=3470.64s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	Again, just as before, the machine may accept 0 strings, one string, many strings, but it always has one language, the collection of all accepted strings. Now, if you have a decider, which is a machine that never loops, which always halts on every input, then we say its language is a decidable language.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=299.14s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	So a multi-tape Turing machine is a Turing machine, as you might imagine, that has more than one-- well, has one or possibly more tapes. And so a single tape Turing machine would be a special version of a multi-tape Turing machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=442.83s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	Now, the language of the machine is the collection of all strings that it ever prints out. So we're defining language in a somewhat different way here. It's not the strings that it accepts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=1960.84s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	It produces the language rather than accepts the strings in the language. It's not really a recognizer. It's a generator. And the language of the machine, as writing over here, for an enumerator here, we say its language is a collection of strings that it prints.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=1985.62s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	We'll start off with the easier direction. Let's say we have an enumerator. Hopefully you got this concept of this Turing machine which periodically prints strings when you started it off on the empty tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=2031.62s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	But just to make things even worse, I have a check in, which is going to be about this one little point here. So I got a question. Where do we get the wi strings? The wi strings are simply the list of all strings in sigma star.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=2411.49s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	But if you look him up on Wikipedia, where I get all my information, he actually, and I knew this anyway, he has a very famous paper, an influential paper, on how, for example, spots arise on leopards and stripes on tigers and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=3253.46s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	Some of these we'll talk about later. But the 10th problem here is about algorithms. The 10th problem on Hilbert's list called Hilbert's 10th problem is a problem about algorithms. And it says give an algorithm for solving what are called Diophantine equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=3417.3s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	The Church-Turing thesis. Somebody asked me, is it proved in the book? There's nothing to prove. The Church-Turing thesis is an equivalence between the intuitive and the formal. You can't prove something like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=4339.87s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	But until someone has a proof that they're different, strange things can happen. OK. So with that, I will move myself into the corner. And let's do our review. So we are-- in order to talk about space complexity classes that are smaller than n, we had to introduce a new model, which was the two-tape model, where there was a read-only tape that had the input on it, which you normally would think of something very large-- the whole internet, or something so big that you can't read it into your local memory.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=146.66s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	We're not going to be measuring time. We're only going to be focusing on how much space we're using. Another example that we gave is the PATH language, where you're given a graph, and a start node, and a target node.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=299.71s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	And so it's really the same idea that says that PATH really captures any NL machine. The computation of any NL machine really can be seen as a PATH problem, where the nodes are the configurations of the machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=2597.15s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	So let's just see how-- let me just try to go through that if that wasn't super clear, which I'm not sure it was. So suppose we have a machine decided by-- a language decided by a nondeterministic-- an NL machine, a nondeterministic machine in log space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=2621.2s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	But what we're going to give is a NL machine, a nondeterministic machine, which is going to compute this function. And therefore, you can use that to do the PATH language. Two important things for us is, if G is some graph, well, here's the starting node, s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=3771.9s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	R is all of the nodes that you can reach from s. This is some collection of nodes. And c, which stands for count, is the number of reachable nodes. So I've written that down here more-- if you like it more formally.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=3794.41s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	I'll talk a little bit about the problem set. And we'll also have a break, as requested, halfway through. So why don't we jump in? What we did last time was besides introducing the course, we introduced finite automata in regular languages, which are the languages that the finite automata can recognize.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=49.84s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So that means we have machines, finite automata, for A1 and A2. We'll call them M1 and M2, that recognize A1 and A2, respectively. And then what we need to do in order to show the concatenation is regular is to make a finite automaton which recognizes the concatenation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=229.2s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	If any one of the states as possibilities that we are right now at the end of the string is an accept state, then we say, overall, the machine has accepted. So that corresponds to what we said over here before-- accept the input if some path leads to an accept.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=833.94s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So here we have what's called a power set. That's the set of subsets of the collection Q. So here we're going to produce an entire subset of states. Instead of just one state coming out, there might be a subset of possible states that you can go to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=1354.57s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So M prime is going to be bigger. OK. So quickly, the construction of M, the states of M prime now, q prime, are going to be the power set, the set of subsets of states from the original machine M.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=1869.315s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So they're not a pair of languages, because a star is a unary operation applying to just a single language. So if we have a DFA recognizing A, in order to show that A star is regular, we have to construct a machine that recognizes A star.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=2677.982s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	Star means you can take as many copies of you lot as you like of strings in the original language, and that's in the star language. So to determine if something is in the star language, you have to see, can I break it up into pieces which are all in the original language? So you want to see, can I take my input w and cut it up into a bunch of pieces-- four, in this case-- where each of those pieces are members of A, the members of the original language? So that's what M prime's job is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=2732.22s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So this machine accepts just the empty string. Or its language is the language with one element, the empty string. How about the empty language? Well, here's an NFA which has no accepting state, so it can't be accepting anything.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=3341.75s
8. Undecidability	If not, we will delay that part until next Tuesday's lecture. All right, acceptance problem for Turing Machines. So just as I mentioned, we showed that A,TM, which is the language of Turing machines and inputs where the machine accepts the input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=119.02s
8. Undecidability	So a one-to-one function is a function that's mapping from A to B. Those are the two sets whose sizes we're trying to compare. And the function being one-to-one just means that there are no collisions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=294.18s
8. Undecidability	But yeah, countable or countably infinite, sometimes people say, if it has the same size as the natural numbers. Or otherwise, you have to include the finite sets as well. And countable means you can just go through the elements of the set as a list.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=970.22s
8. Undecidability	We're going to talk about that a little later. So we're going to come back and revisit this argument in a week or so when we talk about the recursion theorem which talks about machines that can refer to themselves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=3139.693s
8. Undecidability	We showed earlier, the regular, the context-free, decidable, recognizable. Here, I've got the recognizable and what I'm calling the co-Turing recognizable. This is the collection of all complements of recognizable languages. So A,TM bar, A,TM complement is the complement of a recognizable language.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=3619.81s
8. Undecidability	The complement of A,TM is the complement of a recognizable but itself is not recognizable and not decidable. So you got this side of nice, you know-- I hope you think it's nice, but it's sort of a try to summarize things in this little Venn diagram.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=4572.45s
12. Time Complexity	And look at the maximum cost, the maximum number of steps you need, to solve any one of those inputs of a given length. And we'll do that for each length. And the way we're going to frame it is in terms of giving a maximum, or what's called an upper bound, on the amount of time that you need to solve all of those inputs of length n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=317.4s
12. Time Complexity	So this is a collection of languages. The time complexity class is a set of languages. I'm going to draw it now as a diagram. So if you take the language, again, that we've been using as our standard example, a to the k, b to the k, that's n time n log n, as we observed two slides to slides back, or three slides back.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=2034.0s
12. Time Complexity	Let's see. Oh, because a bunch of people apparently are asking the TAs why all regular languages can be done in order n. So if you think about a DFA, which processes an input of length n with n steps, and a DFA is I'm going to be a type of Turing machine that never writes on its tape, so if a DFA can do it in n steps, the Turing machine can do it in n steps.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=2610.66s
12. Time Complexity	Cellular automata, which are just arrays of finite automata that can communicate with each other, similarly. All the reasonable deterministic models, again, classical models, I'm not talking about quantum computing, are polynomially related.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=3138.33s
12. Time Complexity	The PATH language, which is where I'm going to give you a graph G, two nodes in the graph, s and t, where I'm thinking of G as a directed graph. So directed means that the connections between the nodes in G are going to be directed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=3502.73s
12. Time Complexity	So I'm looking for a path that goes, that hits every node of G, not just the shortest, most direct path. But in a sense, the most indirect path, the longest path that goes through from s to t that visits everything else along the way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=4044.75s
12. Time Complexity	A path of that kind, that hits every node of the graph is called a Hamiltonian path. Because the mathematician Hamilton studied those and made some definitions about that. I'm not going to-- I don't actually know the history there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=4059.57s
12. Time Complexity	MICHAEL SIPSER: Yeah, so we actually-- we're going to-- we will talk about Oracle Turing machines later on in the term. These are machines that have access to sort of free information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=4976.06s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Then why do we know it's a minimum? Well, that's always the second -- the quadratic terms here are going to be positive. So we have a positive definite problem. Positive definite means things go this way, convex, and you locate the bottom, the minimum is where the derivative is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94nmfDkTL-E#t=262.81s
Lec 27 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And I want to say also a word about -- more than a word -- about alpha going to 0. And then, the real problems come when alpha is in between. The real problem -- the situations, these ill-posed problems that come from inverse problems, trying to find out what's inside your brain by taking measurements at the skull.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVUsEwSg-lw#t=29.78s
Lec 27 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	OK, so that matrix has a row space. The row space is the set of all vectors that are a combinations of the rows. But there's only one row, so the row space is only a line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVUsEwSg-lw#t=1905.81s
Lec 27 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Four fundamental subspaces they've come to be called. OK and the null space is the vectors which B takes to 0. B takes any vector into its column space. So now let me just draw what happens to u equal u null space plus u row space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVUsEwSg-lw#t=2614.45s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Iterative means that I never actually get to the perfect answer x, but I get close and what I want to do is get close quickly. So a lot of thought has gone into creating iterative methods.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtNVodIs1dI#t=96.8s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Weighted Jacobi is to take, instead of p -- put in a weight. So weighted Jacobi -- let me put this here and we'll come back to it. So weighted Jacobi simply takes P to be the diagonal over a factor omega.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtNVodIs1dI#t=2643.86s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And it's called the entropy condition, which says that this can't happen. That the derivative of entropy has a certain sign and it rules this out. It rules out this possibility of characteristics emerging from the shock and we need a totally different solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sleOqiMUTXE#t=756.15s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	You're keeping your eye on the integral form of the conservation law. I'll just come back to it again. The derivative of the mass, the integral of u-- so in the discrete case, the difference of capital U-- plus the integrated term of flux at one end of the interval minus a flux at the other end.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sleOqiMUTXE#t=1792.06s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So it has what we want. It gives us good answers when the solution is smooth, it stays near the shock the way Lax-Wendroff does, but it doesn't oscillate. OK, so what's the flux limiter? The flux limiter is, I multiply in here by some function, the limiter function, phi_(j+1) and I multiply in here by phi_j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sleOqiMUTXE#t=2336.96s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So last time, we got Euler's method, both ordinary, forward Euler, which is this method for the particular equation -- so I'm using my model problem, as always, u prime equal a*u.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlO9ci0kPLg#t=33.27s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	But here it's a scalar, it's just a division, so what is stability going to depend on? What does stability require? At every step, we don't want to grow. So if we take a step -- that's 1 plus a over 2 delta t divided by 1 minus a over 2 delta t, that's the growth factor, the decay factor that multiplies U_n to give you n plus 1, so the stability question is, is this smaller or equal to 1? That's stability for this trapezoidal method.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlO9ci0kPLg#t=1135.65s
Lec 18 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And I had a lot of email with Tim Davis. On that one-page handout, for 2D Laplace's equation, it mentions N cubed for the nested dissection, where you cut the region in half, and half, and half, by separators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIydsgrYGIY#t=73.36s
Lec 18 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So M was the Jacobi matrix, the iteration matrix with Jacobi, which is I minus D inverse A This is for the 1D second differences. In fact, this was the 5 by 5 matrix that we've been talking about.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIydsgrYGIY#t=180.68s
Lec 18 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The reason is, I should have been doing I minus S M. When I do that, I'm not disappointed anymore. What are the eigenvalues of this? You remember, S is the matrix that tells us how much error we're capturing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIydsgrYGIY#t=254.63s
Lec 18 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And those eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of V transpose V, are the singular values, or rather the singular values squared, of V. So I guess I'm saying, you can't trust the eigenvalues of V.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIydsgrYGIY#t=2117.97s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	There's a leap there, but let me start with semidiscrete. We haven't done this until today. Semidiscrete means, as you see, that the time variable stays continuous. We have ordinary differential equations in t, but the space variable is what's getting discrete.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa6fUHTTeU#t=493.25s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So I'm going to look for pure exponentials and we'll quickly find them. And then I'm going to do the same for semidiscrete, where that x becomes j delta x and I'm at point j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa6fUHTTeU#t=635.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Now I'm taking the jump, the jump from one exponential, a particular k that gave me these particular guys, to all exponentials and assembling all exponentials into functions. So why is that OK? It's only OK in this because of this very special situation that all frequencies are behaving the same here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa6fUHTTeU#t=1096.86s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The b minus w squared is bigger, so the sum is b squared plus another term. So that's weak duality, that for any choice, some inequality holds, since this is never negative -- another way to say weak duality would be to say that this is always greater or equal to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEsObJTwDXI#t=188.57s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	But we recognize, if you want to identify some object by scattering, by radar data and other scattering data. Well, there are just lots of others. Oh, and then the general question of: we have a Laplace or a Poisson equation, which is the divergence of some inhomogeneous material property equals some f of x, y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEsObJTwDXI#t=1324.46s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	OK, so what we're usually doing, in this course and most courses, is the direct problem of find u, so the direct problem is find u. And what's the inverse problem? The inverse problem is we know u and f and we have to find c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEsObJTwDXI#t=1377.99s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Mostly I'll think of a as a real, and often negative. Often the equation will be stable. A negative a means that e to the a*t decreases. A negative definite matrix, negative eigenvalues, mean that the matrix exponential decays.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv-AB35V2k8#t=619.77s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So backward Euler for linear system, big linear system, is a matrix inversion, well a matrix linear system to solve. But for a non-linear problem, it's serious work. And yet, you have to do the work if the explicit method gives you such a small delta t that it's impossible to go with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv-AB35V2k8#t=2628.5s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	I started to talk about the eigenvectors of A and I didn't finish. If I want to get formulas for these I need to know the eigenvectors of A. So A, this matrix of 2's and minus 1's, the eigenvectors of that matrix are discrete sine functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y25UBGeu_2g#t=2601.68s
Lec 7 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And what we did then was to solve it. Give an analytical solution. Both for any initial value u of x and 0, and then, specifically for the point source. So then, we're talking about the impulse response, or the fundamental solution, when we start from a delta function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByGXz_uHEdM#t=29.83s
Lec 7 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	That's always the idea. Start with U_(j, 0) as e to the i*k*j delta x, and follow it up. We're looking for a growth factor G, the growth factor in a single step, and, of course, the point is, it depends on k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByGXz_uHEdM#t=830.44s
Lec 26 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So I've spoken pretty quickly here, and let me just conclude. This is the limit equation, is the correct limit equation. This is the limit equation that we want to solve one way or another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUOJ-uQ8F0#t=1529.12s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Today I'm going to call it u star. So it's u star is the winner, small u star. Let me take time-out, one minute time-out, on a board -- I mean, optimization is about the problem of minimizing some function F of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XosfcouiM#t=783.21s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Argument is a fancy word for the variable in the function. So this says the argument that gives the minimum of F of x, and that's what we're looking for to name.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XosfcouiM#t=897.96s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And that equation is named after Korteweg-de Vries, KdV it's often called. I'll just put that down; KdV is the shorthand for that equation. And it comes up in water waves, one-way water waves actually, along a shallow channel.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpTzMWTYbM8#t=76.43s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Well, how is that? Is this quantity, the shock speed-- no, greater than-- is this shock speed-- so checking that entropy condition means-- shall I put it up here? u_L bigger than-- so this was the characteristic speeds, the wave speeds on the left of the shock.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpTzMWTYbM8#t=1322.74s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And the solutions, I have to say what the solutions are called. Those waves that I mentioned, which-- they're not quite that bad-- are called solitons, solitary waves. And it was the interaction of solitons and the fact that they emerged looking unchanged that set off this horrific effort to figure out what was going on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpTzMWTYbM8#t=3118.43s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	OK, so next time, it's a little more about numerical solutions of these equations and then about the level set method. And then, looking ahead, we have a guest lecture on financial mathematics, the PDEs of financial math, for everybody who wants to go to New York and make a billion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpTzMWTYbM8#t=3302.93s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	OK. So I think you'll like this topic. It's kind of specific but widely used -- linear programming -- used in business to maximize profits, to minimize costs. And linear means that the cost function is linear.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=109.89s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The simplex method is the best established, best known approach for solving these problems. What's the idea of the simplex method? The simplex method finds a corner. A corner is a case where we have some equality signs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=447.35s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	A corner is the edge, the limit where maybe this one still has x_1 positive but it's down in this plane so it has maybe x_3 is 0 for this guy. So that corner has x_3 equals 0 and it also lies right on the plane, so it has A*x equal to b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=473.21s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Anyway, corners are points where some of the constraints are tight or active and others are not. Well, you might say: just check them all, but the trouble is there are lots of corners.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=515.17s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	It chooses the direction in which the cost -- the gradient, the component of the gradient, you could say, along that edge is the biggest, or maybe the most negative. And then, once it decides which way to go, it goes -- maybe it takes this direction -- it goes, goes, goes, goes, goes until it hits another corner.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=613.15s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	If the cost goes up in all directions, along all the edges out of that corner, then that corner has won. It's the minimum. I'm using linearity here -- the fact that you know everything by traveling along, by looking along those edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=702.34s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Weak duality, which is easy to prove, says that, always, c*x, for any feasible x, is greater or equal to y*b for any feasible y. So any x and y that satisfy the constraints.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=1523.84s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So Newton's method always comes in reality with some kind of a trust region, some region where you can rely on the derivative being a reasonable approximation of the way the function is moving.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=2763.13s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The projection in the other direction -- we called that P. This was the projection P equal A times the best x. The projection in the opposite direction found the e, the error, but it was the solution to the dual problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=3142.59s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	This thing should be b minus A*x squared. Anyway, the duality is in the fact of getting an equal sign there and weak duality is the easy inequality that no matter what you do, you get greater than or equal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpwsw7SdkyY#t=3319.42s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	I don't know which way you -- here, this shows you the real and imaginary parts. That makes it nice. This shows you the two coefficients. That makes it nice. Can you see stability -- so what is Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy? The characteristic discussion, the argument based on characteristics, says what? Stability is going mean that delta t -- stability is going to happen when r is below 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwDX-3IPT0#t=541.63s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	All right. If you've done any computing, you, when you see these oscillations, you immediately think of somebody's name, which is Gibbs. Of course, Gibbs -- do you remember the Gibbs phenomenon that comes when you're approximating a square wave, like there, by pure Fourier series? So the Gibbs, the classical Gibbs phenomenon is, take the Fourier series for a square wave -- well, it's smooth -- and then truncate that series, cut that series off at 100 terms or 1,000 terms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwDX-3IPT0#t=1711.08s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Even on this simple model problem, you'll have to have this idea of numerical viscosity. Artificial viscosity, numerical diffusion popped in at the right spot. So we'll see that. Maybe the right place to see it will be for when the equation itself is already nonlinear.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwDX-3IPT0#t=1910.37s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	I've got four words on the board, four keywords here. Stability, we kind of know what that means. Convergence. These are the new words and I'll just -- and actually -- so consistent means that the method is at least first order and that the difference equation approaches the differential equation at a single step.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwDX-3IPT0#t=2059.64s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Well-posed means that the differential equation is OK. So, for example, what would be a non-well-posed problem? When we get to the heat equation, if you ran the heat equation backward in time, that would give us an equation du/dt as minus u_xx.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwDX-3IPT0#t=2088.15s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So that's what R and S are. Now, we got three ideas here. What does well-posed mean? Well-posed means that the true thing is bounded. That R to the n-th times u is less than some constant times u.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHwDX-3IPT0#t=2312.42s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Now what are those? What will that produce? i will be the list of nonzeros, the list of the row numbers of the nonzeros. So i will be-- maybe I'll write it as a row so I'm transposing, So the row numbers would be row 1, row 2, not row 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPo4dHK48Nw#t=423.97s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And that's what we'll get. Actually, that Kronecker product business, a Kronecker product of a 1D matrix like that with itself would be a 2D interpolation that would do exactly this. We can write it out more fully, but it's not fun to write out really fully because if this is 5 by 2, then I2D would be 25 by 4.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPo4dHK48Nw#t=2329.06s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And then the question is, what's A_(2h)? And there's a beautiful answer, so let me just say what it is. A_(2h), the coarse mesh matrix, is the fine mesh matrix, but I need to do first-- if this is going to apply to the coarse mesh guys, the v's, I have to do an interpolation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPo4dHK48Nw#t=2659.62s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	It's so important that people don't stop thinking. So another sort of high-level picture of how to do an ordering is look for graph separators. That's become a big step in the world of computational graph theory, and that leads to something called nested dissection, which is separators of separators of separators, the usual keep going with the same idea that you see in algorithms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw885-SZI#t=851.07s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And then a slash, and then whatever node three -- so I need -- I guess I need one more line there to tell me -- I need a pointer. I need a line, a pointer that tells me, number one, start with the first one -- one, two, three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw885-SZI#t=2558.64s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So a separator is a set of nodes that separates the rest of the nodes into two groups. So I have a group of nodes P, a group of nodes Q and nothing, no connections between P and Q. P is this part.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw885-SZI#t=2841.19s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Q is a similar part over there. S, the separator, is the part with the connection. So P is connected to Q only through S. So now if I think of ordering, in what order should I take the P, the Q and the S? Our absolute rule is, everything's connected to S, put it last.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw885-SZI#t=2859.22s
Lec 22 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Now I've accounted for the constraint. I've removed w2 from the problem. I have a minimization, an ordinary minimization with an unknown w1. I take the derivative. I solve derivative equals zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIK5EnoiLL0#t=2004.69s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Another bigger picture -- for us, actually, bigger will be quadratic programming where the quantity that's being minimized is a quadratic function. Now what's good about a quadratic function? Its derivatives are linear.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dVYOOHB4g4#t=135.64s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	But in statistics, this is the topic of linear regression in statistics. Let me write down -- they gave the name normal equation to the equation that gives u directly. Do you remember what it is? The normal equation? The equation for the minimizing u, which we could find by calculus? It involves the key matrix A transpose A. Let me call u hat the minimizer, the winner in this competition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dVYOOHB4g4#t=535.85s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So the set of all A*u's I think of as a -- you could say a plane, an n-dimensional plane within the bigger space R^m. Another name for that subspace, that plane, is the -- in 18.06 I would call it the column space of A, or the range of A is another expression that you--.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dVYOOHB4g4#t=884.84s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	I call the bandwidth just 1 here. Really, maybe half bandwidth would be a better word. The bandwidth is the number of diagonals above or below -- take the maximum of the count above and the count below and in this case, both counts are 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1-r1t5i58g#t=569.12s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Now I use the word condition number and that -- so let me write that down. Condition number -- say c of K for condition number -- is the ratio lambda_max over lambda_min.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1-r1t5i58g#t=1143.38s
Lec 25 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	That's what delta stands for. And that's an uncomfortable operator to work with, the inverse here. In matrix language, when we discretize, it won't be sparse, right? The Laplacian is sparse, the Laplacian gives us the five-point matrix, the matrix with five non-0's on every row -- four on the diagonal and four minus 1's, that matrix that we know, the K2D matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-C6QC5ufSw#t=652.67s
Lec 25 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The null vector is a vector when the pressure is 1, minus 1, 1, minus 1 in a checkerboard pattern over the whole region, and a corresponding velocity. Well, the trouble is A_h times this p is 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-C6QC5ufSw#t=1448.47s
Lec 25 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So the application is to inverse problems. What's an inverse problem? An inverse problem is, for a differential equation, you know some inputs and outputs, you know some solutions, but you don't know the equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-C6QC5ufSw#t=2762.27s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So the idea was that the eigenvectors, the details of the eigenvectors, will be affected by boundary conditions. So von Neumann thought, all right, I'll cut through that Gordian knot and just pretend I have a pure e to the i*k*x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpOJJk6en2o#t=3163.29s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	We'll just, sort of, see how much work is involved. But let me begin where we were last time, which was Arnoldi. So Arnoldi was a Gram-Schmidt-like algorithm, not exactly Gram-Schmidt, that produced an orthogonal basis, and that basis is the basis for the Krylov subspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zha1744fTRs#t=67.59s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	I'm looking at minimizing -- so optimization, the part that's coming in April, is minimizing energy, minimizing function, and what's the link? Well, if I minimize that, the gradient of this is -- how shall I write? grad E, the gradient of E, the list of the derivatives of E with respect to the x_i, and if we work that out -- well, why not pretend it's scalar for the moment, so these are just numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zha1744fTRs#t=1612.22s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So this is not 90 degrees unless you're in the A inner product. So this is a 90 degree angle in the A inner product. And what does the A inner product do? In the A inner product, in which level sets are circles, or spheres or whatever, in whatever dimension we want.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zha1744fTRs#t=2480.49s
6. Wave Profiles, Heat Equation / point source	So that's past things, but still very much present, if I can say. Here I've introduced a new leapfrog, a one-way equation leapfrog, I'll call this, where the last lecture was about two-way leapfrog.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPmBMd6OZeQ#t=568.3s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	In the diffusion part, one often does that. The diffusion is the term, is the one that's forcing us to take this coefficient R below a half, delta t of order delta x squared, and the way to avoid that is to move the viscosity term, at least half of it, up to the new time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=783.39s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	If our body is warm and we're holding it at zero on its boundary, then heat is going to travel out. And in fact, as time goes to infinity, we're going to approach cold -- a uniformly cold.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=950.39s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And now I wanted to mention a third type of boundary, which is a purely computational boundary. We talked last time about Maxwell's equations in free space, and the big application of Maxwell's equations, or one of the big ones historically, has been to, like, the exterior of an airplane, to radar, or other electromagnetic signals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=985.57s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The idea of this perfectly matched layer is to create an artificial dielectric, I guess, a dielectric medium it would be, in the electromagnetic case. An artificial thin layer, which has just the right properties to stop the wave and swallow it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=1150.15s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And the way to see what continues to happen is to go to the integrated form, the integral form of the equation, where, of course, by taking an integral, I make everything smoother, and also I preserve the physical law, the conservation law.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=2061.14s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	That's the viscosity method, a fundamental method, for finding out when we run into a problem, shocks run into each other. We don't know what to choose. One way to find out, in this 1D problem and also in much tougher nonlinear multidimensional problems, is put a little viscosity in, and let it be small.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=2364.58s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	OK, another example of conservation laws that everybody likes, I think, is the traffic flow, traffic flow in one direction, say, on the Mass. Pike. So what's the equation of traffic flow? Let me put that on a board here, and then I have to come back to this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=2509.21s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	That now, it's 0 on the left and 1 on the right, where before, it was 1 on the left and 0 on the right. And the question is, what happens in here? Well, you might think a shock, a step up from 0 to 1 at some point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=2964.87s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	One is to locate the shock, the shock line, when there is one, and two, to decide -- how do we decide between shock or fan when from the point of view of pure conservation, we could choose.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrTXj13DNk#t=3078.25s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	And they're the lines on which the information travels. Whatever the information was at times 0. By information, I mean the value of u at 0, 0, or the value of u at this point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxNyJxI_2eI#t=669.84s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	He found out that the first horse has 20% chance to win. The second horse has 80% chance to win. He is actually right about his knowledge about chances to win. On the other hand, general public, people who bet, they don't have access to all information, and the bets are split slightly differently.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=142.84s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	What are the examples of financial derivatives? Well, the most simple example is probably a forward contract. Forward contracts is a contract when you agree to purchase the security for a price which is set today -- you've agreed to purchase the security in the future for the price agreed today.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=373.25s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	European basically means that the contract expires at certain time T. American means that's you can exercise this contract at any time between now and future. We'll be talking only about European contracts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=492.45s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	So European call option is a contract which gives you the right, but not obligation, to purchase the underlying security at set price K, which is called strike price, at a future time T, which is expiration time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=507.27s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Let's assume that we are in a very simple world. Well, first of all, in our world there are only three objects -- the stock itself, the riskless money market account, meaning that it is an account where we can either borrow money or invest money at the riskless rate r, and finally our derivative contract.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=839.88s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	The very common assumption is that the dynamics of the stock is log-normal. Log-normal meaning that the logarithm of the stock is actually normally distributed. So, here mu is some drift, sigma is the volatility of our stock, and dW is a Wiener process, W is a Wiener process such that dW is normally distributed with mean zero and variance square root dt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=1347.27s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	As you know, both explicit and implicit schemes, and you will discuss some of those in 18.086. Tree methods. Tree methods meaning that we go back to our one-step tree, and basically assume that our time to expiration is many time steps away and we'll grow the tree further, so from this node we have two more nodes, and so and so forth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=2267.2s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	Probabilities implied by the market, actually. Another important numerical method is Monte Carlo simulation where you would simulate many different scenarios of the development of your stock up to the maturity, and then, basically find -- using this path, you will find the expected value of your payout.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=2328.96s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.086 Mathematical Methods for Engineers II	But if you get into more complicated fields, especially into credit modeling, the model for the credits of certain companies, then mathematics is not quite set, because there, you start talking about jump processes and not Wiener processes, not just log-normal processes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEuuJ5E7ZS0#t=2853.61s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And the method I used last time was to describe something called a fundamental matrix. A fundamental matrix for the system or for A, whichever you want, remember what that was. That was a two-by-two matrix of functions of t and whose columns were two independent solutions, x1, x2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zreI4HllD80#t=57.0s
Exploration of the Phase Lines Applet	This is a logistic equation with harvesting. Specifically, this is a model of the oryx population in a certain game preserve in Kenya, measured in kilooryx and years. The Kenyan government wants to sell permits to kill 1/4 kilooryx per year, and it wants to know how large a game preserve it should create to guarantee a stable oryx population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d521hz0sGtE#t=44.21s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	It only has a slope at each point. It doesn't have any magnitude or direction. It has the direction, but it doesn't have direction in the sense of an arrow telling me whether it is going this way or the opposite way. That is the picture with t in it. These are the corresponding degeneration of that. It is a coarsening, it's a cheapening of it. It is throwing away information. Throw away all the information that had to do with t, and we are back in the first days of the terms with a single first order equations involving only x and y with solutions that involve only x and y with curves that are the graphs of these solutions but again have no t in them. In effect, they are just the paths of the trajectories. Whereas, the trajectory is the point that shows actually how the point is moving along in time faster or slower at various points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR9EVzr4lc#t=552.0s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	But, if I do that, I change the geometric type. In other words, being a borderline, a slight change of the parameters can change what it changes to. And, in fact, that is geometrically clear. What does a center look like? A center looks like this, a bunch of curves going around all in the same direction, like concentric circles or maybe ellipses or something like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR9EVzr4lc#t=1714.0s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Take the derivative, find out where the maximum point is and you will find, perhaps you have already done it, this is at one. The maximum occurs at one, that is where the derivative is zero and the value there is one times e to the minus one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR9EVzr4lc#t=2254.0s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	You have a tank, a room, I don't know, where everything's getting mixed in. It has a certain volume, which I will call v. Something is flowing in, a gas or a liquid.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzfsfBNJIw#t=1581.031s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This is the diffusion model, where salt solution outside, cell in the middle, salt diffusing through a semi-permeable membrane into that, uses Newton's law of diffusion, except he didn't do a law of diffusion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzfsfBNJIw#t=2030.308s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	In general, there are not analytic formulas for the solutions to nonlinear systems like that. There are only computer-drawn things. But sometimes you have to get qualitative information, a quick idea of how the trajectories look.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJG0f0BSX14#t=120.0s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Now, what would they be? They are the solutions that consist of a single point. How could a solution be a single point? Well, like the origin for a linear system, those points which form solutions all by themselves are called the critical points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJG0f0BSX14#t=811.637s
Exploration of the Damped Vibrations Applet	And you'll notice that they get closer and closer to the real axis as well. Their imaginary part is decreasing. That means that the circular frequency, the angular frequency of the solution, is decreasing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb5o6VNboV0#t=294.04s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This is a square matrix. This is what is called a matrix differential equation where the variable is not a single x or a column vector of a set of x's like the x and the y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuTN8rpe4I#t=920.114s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The method says look for a solution of that form. The variation parameters, these are the parameters that are now varying instead of being constants. Now, if you take it in that form and start trying to substitute into the equation you are going to get a mess.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuTN8rpe4I#t=2222.0s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	But, before that, I'd like to begin by clearing up a couple of questions almost everybody has at some point or other when they study the case of complex roots. Complex roots are the case which produce oscillations in the solutions. That's the relation, and that's why I'm talking about this for the first few minutes. Now, what is the problem? The complex roots, of course, there will be two roots, and they occur at the complex conjugates of each other. So, they will be of the form a plus or minus bi. Last time, I showed you, I took the root r equals a plus bi, which leads to the solution. The corresponding solution is a complex solution which is e to the at, (a plus i b)t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7HEE8-OfA#t=81.621s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I remember very well from Friday to Monday, but I can't expect you to for a variety of reasons. I mean, I have to think about this stuff all weekend. And you, God forbid. So, here's the picture, and I won't explain anymore what's in it, except there's the mass. Here is the spring constant, the spring with its constant here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7HEE8-OfA#t=1419.692s
Linear Equations | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone. So today I'd like to take a look at linear equations, linear first-order differential equations. And specifically, we're going to look at just exactly, what is a linear equation? So for example, which of these equations are linear? And then second of all, we're going to take a look at superposition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrRgAWI6bmw#t=6.65s
Linear Equations | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	And I imagined that I have a solution y_1 which satisfies this differential equation and y_2 which satisfies this differential equation. So what does the superposition principle say? Well, superposition says that if y_1 solves this equation and y_2 solves this equation, then the function y equals y_1 plus y_2 must solve the equation y dot plus y squared equals the sum of the right-hand side, 1 plus t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrRgAWI6bmw#t=434.86s
Linear Systems: Matrix Methods | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	So now, we did big part of the work. The matrix method tells us that we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix to be able to basically diagonalize it and seek eigenvectors so that then we can just read off the solutions and write the solution of the system as a linear combination of the eigenvectors that we found.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUjdyKhWt6E#t=65.39s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	"And, the condition is universally said this way, should be of exponential type. So, what I'm defining is the phrase ""exponential type."" I'll put it in quotation marks for that reason. What does this mean? It's a condition, a growth condition on a function, says how fast it can get big."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=196.286s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	We need more formulas. So, I'll put them, why don't I save this board, and instead, I'll describe to you the basic way Laplace transforms are used to solve differential equations, what are they called, a paradigm. I'll show you the paradigm, and then we'll fill in the holes so you have some overall view of how the procedure goes, and then you'll understand where the various pieces fit into it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=917.141s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And, the answer will always come out to be Y equals, Y of s equals some rational function, some quotient of polynomials in s, a polynomial in s divided by some other polynomial in s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=1185.445s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	What you would do instead is-- How are we going to fill that in? Well, a second derivative is also a first derivative. A second derivative is the first derivative of the first derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=1905.205s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	A stiff spring, one that pulls with hard force is going to make that thing go back and forth, particularly at the dipping is weak. So, let's use almost the same equation as I've just concealed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP-oRQqmeg4#t=2156.38s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	"And we have so far two basic methods of solving it. The first one, on which we spent the most time, is the method of where you calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix, the eigenvectors, and put them together to make the general solution. So eigenvalues, e-vectors and so on. The second method, which I gave you last time, I called ""royal road,"" simply calculates the matrix e to the At and says that the solution is e to the At times x zero, the initial condition. That is very elegant."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=36.0s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Coupled means that the x and y occur in both equations on the right-hand side. And, therefore, you cannot solve separately for x and y, you must solve together for both of them. Here I can solve separately for u and v and, therefore, the system has been decoupled.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=360.0s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Sometimes it is called the two compartment ice cube tray problem, a very old-fashion type of ice cube tray. Not a modern one that is all plastic where there is no leaking from one compartment to another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=452.0s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Or, you rotate it. That's okay, too. And the matrix defines a linear transformation to the plane, every vector goes to another vector. The question it asks is, is there a vector which is taken by this linear transformation and just left alone or stretched, is kept in the same direction but stretched? Or, maybe its direction is reversed and it is stretched or it shrunk. But, in general, if there are real eigenvalues there will be such vectors that are just left in the same direction but just stretched or shrunk. And what is the lambda? The lambda then is the amount by which they are stretched or shrunk, the factor. This way, first we have to find the vector, which is left essentially unchanged, and then the number here that goes with it is the stretching factor or the shrinking factor. But the end result is the pair alpha one and lambda one, regardless of which order you find them, satisfied the same equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=2042.0s
Lec 26 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	It is circular table. Everyone is dying equally. Everybody can get input from the other two cells. x1 prime is some constant of conductivity times the temperature difference between tank three and tank one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtWqTPPXuc#t=334.0s
Lec 26 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	A defective eigenvalue is one where you can get one eigenvector. If it is double, for example, if it a double eigenvalue. It is defective if you can get one eigenvector that goes with it, but you cannot find an independent one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtWqTPPXuc#t=1830.0s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And therefore, it's okay to separate the two integrals out that way because I'm integrating sort of a rectangle that goes to infinity that way and infinity that way. But, what I'm integrating is over the plane, in other words, this region of the plane as u, v goes from zero to infinity, zero to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ejfkMHr_DE#t=1122.0s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Let's say t is in years. You like to have units, and quantity, kilograms, I don't know, whatever you want. Now, what does the dumping rate mean? The dumping rate means that if I have two times that are close together, for example, two successive days, midnight on two successive days, then there's a time interval between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ejfkMHr_DE#t=1803.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And therefore, the final result is that our Fourier series, the Fourier series for f of t, that funny function is, the Fourier series is summation bn, which is two, put the two out front because it's in every term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWa5_OXI6VM#t=1415.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Taylor series concentrates at this point, does it the best it can at this point. Then it tries, with the next term, to do a little better, and then a little better. The whole philosophy is entirely different. Taylor series are used for analyzing what a function of looks like which you stick close to the base point. Fourier series analyze what a function looks like over the whole interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWa5_OXI6VM#t=1600.421s
Euler's Method | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	I'm going to write f of n. f of n is to denote f evaluated at x of n and y of n. And then, it's also useful to write down h times f of n because the quantity h times f of n comes up in the addition of y of n plus 1 is equal to y of n plus h times f of n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5-ucBtneVM#t=192.24s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	From the point of view of the field they are where the field is zero. There is no velocity vector, in other words. The velocity vector is zero. And, therefore, a point being there has no reason to go anywhere else. And, spelling it out, it's where the partial derivatives, where the values of the functions on the right-hand side, which give the two components, the i and j components of the field, where they are zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=157.0s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	These are commonplace, and we are interested in good stuff today. And the good stuff we are interested in is limit cycles. A limit cycle is a closed trajectory with a couple of extra hypotheses. It is a closed trajectory, just like those guys, but it has something they don't have, namely, it is king of the roost.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=465.686s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And the ones that start further away will take longer to find their way to the limit cycle and they will always stay outside of the earlier guys, but they will get arbitrarily close, too. How about inside? Inside, well, it starts somewhere and does the same thing. It starts here and will try to join the limit cycle. That is what I mean by stability. Stability means that nearby guys, the guys that start somewhere else eventually approach the limit cycle, regardless of whether they start from the outside or start from the inside.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=614.569s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The positive sense means the one which keeps the region, the inside on your left, as you walk around like that the region stays on your left. That is the positive sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=1591.0s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	That is the sense in which I am integrating. I am going to use Green's theorem, but the integral that I am going to calculate is not the work integral. I am going to calculate instead the flux integral, the integral that represents the flux of F across C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=1602.19s
Laplace Transform: Basics | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	Laplace transform of the function s was defined as the integral from 0 minus to infinity of the function f of t exponential minus s*t dt. So note here, the interval of integration is 0 minus to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BniJM-ireXQ#t=58.63s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	There's a condition which guarantees their solution, which is what? What has to be true about the coefficients? These are the coefficients. What has to be true? The matrix of coefficients must be invertible. The determinant of coefficients must be nonzero. So, they are solvable if, for the c1 and c2, if this thing, I'm going to write it. Since all of these are evaluated at x0, I'm going to write it in this way. y1, the determinant, whose entries are y1, y2, y1 prime, and y2 prime, evaluated at zero, x0, that means that I evaluate each of the functions in the determinant at x0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ3-nFV6l8w#t=1435.371s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	There is another way of writing those that you should learn, and that's called finding normalized, the normalized. They are okay, but they are not normalized. For some things, the normalized solutions are the best. I'll explain to you what they are, and I'll explain to you what they're good for.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ3-nFV6l8w#t=2066.445s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The initial value problem has one and only one solution. The existence is, it has a solution. The uniqueness is, it only has one solution. If you specify the initial conditions, there's only one function which satisfies them and at the same time satisfies that differential equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ3-nFV6l8w#t=2791.404s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And so far, the response, then, is the solution equals the corresponding solution, y of t, maybe with some given initial conditions to pick out a special one we call the response, the response to that particular input. And now, over the last few days, the inputs have been, however, extremely special.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWWw0jryj1A#t=120.0s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Well, I want them really on the whole real axis, not there. Define for all real numbers. Then, I say that they are orthogonal, perpendicular. But nobody says perpendicular. Orthogonal is the word, orthogonal on the interval minus pi to pi if the integral, so, two are orthogonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWWw0jryj1A#t=803.953s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The answer turns out to be pi. All right, now, the ways to prove it are you can use trig identities. And, I'm asking you in one of the early problems in the problem set, identities, identities for the product of sine and cosine, expressing it in a form in which it's easy to integrate, and you can prove it that way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWWw0jryj1A#t=1163.703s
Linearization | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	And so it makes sense that we have basically an unstable point here, an unstable critical point, because as soon as we add one prey or one predator, we would have an increase of the prey population, eventually the predator would grow, and so we would have a solution that basically escapes the area around the critical point (0,0).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCpMao94iFg#t=812.79s
Lec 7 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, this goes to zero as t goes, and it doesn't matter what c is, as t goes to infinity. This term stays some sort of function. And so, this term is called the steady-state or long-term solution, or it's called both, a long-term solution. And this, which disappears, gets smaller and smaller as time goes on, is therefore called the transient because it disappears at the time increases to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SioXozu-Loo#t=228.397s
Lec 25 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This is a scalar. You cannot subtract the scalar from a matrix. It is not an operation. To subtract matrices they have to be the same size, the same shape. What is done is you make this a two-by-two matrix. This is a two-by-two matrix with lambdas down the main diagonal and I elsewhere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heBvViSi9xQ#t=2799.476s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, let's call it, as I called it in the notes, the exponential input theorem, which says it all. Theorem says it's important. Exponential input means it's taking f of x to be an exponential.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KbpbBMThTE#t=662.0s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Okay, what's the real number? Okay, we're looking for the real part of this expression. So, just put it in and keep it mentally. So, minus one squared: that's one, plus i squared, that's minus one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KbpbBMThTE#t=1257.157s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	That's zero. So, I'm in the second case. So, i omega nought is a simple root, simple zero, of D squared plus omega nought, that polynomial squared. Therefore, the complex particular solution is now t e to the i omega nought t divided by p prime, where you plug in that root, the i omega nought.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_zrupnz0Q#t=886.36s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And, I'm going to divide it by this same guy. So, this is part of the complementary solution. That's what we call the complementary solution, the solution to the associated homogeneous equation, to the reduced equation. Call it what you like.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_zrupnz0Q#t=1311.475s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And, it's only after you divided out by the m that you're allowed to call this the square of the natural frequency. So, omega naught is the natural frequency, the natural undamped frequency. If this term were not there, that omega nought would give the frequency with which the system, the little spring would like to vibrate by itself. Now, further complication is that the visual uses neither of these.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_zrupnz0Q#t=2196.623s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I will try to use all these terms now and then, probably most often I will lapse into input as the most generic term, suggesting nothing in particular, and therefore, equally acceptable or unacceptable to everybody. The response, the solution, then, the solution as you know is then called the response. The response, sometimes it's called the output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNm7XGJr4s#t=112.155s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I'll just use the word, forced system, that's where f of t is not zero, versus the passive system where there is no external applied force. The passive system, the forced system, now, you have to both, even if you wanted to solve the forced system, the way the system would behave if nothing would be done to it from the outside is nonetheless going to be an important part of the solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNm7XGJr4s#t=540.0s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	In other words, when I write that, I am no longer interested in the whole equation. All I'm interested in is the reduced equation, the equation where you turn the f of t on the right-hand side into zero. So, what's the stability condition? Well, let's write it out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNm7XGJr4s#t=2533.348s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The most closely analogous thing would be a linear equation, a real linear equation, the kind you studied in high school, which would look like this. It would have two variables, and, I guess, constant coefficients, equal c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=163.4s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	But, this is the external temperature. So, I'll indicate it with an e. Now, what is the model? Well, in other words, how do I set up a differential equation to model the situation? Well, it's based on a physical law, which I think you know, you've had simple examples like this, the so called Newton's Law of cooling, -- -- which says that the rate of change, the temperature of the heat goes from the outside to the inside by conduction only.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=745.5s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I don't think Newton got his name on this. The diffusion equation says that the rate at which the salt diffuses across the membrane, which is the same up to a constant as the rate at which the concentration inside changes, is some constant, usually called k still, okay.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=1109.5s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This, therefore, is called the steady state solution, the thing which the temperature behaves like, as T goes to infinity. This is called the transient. because it disappears as T goes to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=2988.0s
Exploration of the Euler's Method Applet	So this now, it produces a polygon, the Euler polygon, which will stay closer to the actual curve than the simple tangent line approximation did. I can continue this process by continuing to say Next Step.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz1d0rHn_fU#t=187.81s
Phase Portraits | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	PROFESSOR: Welcome to this recitation on the phase portrait. So you're given matrix A, a two-by-two matrix with entries minus 1, minus 1, 1 minus c, where c is a constant we will be varying, and minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmzyW1rP-hk#t=6.409s
Phase Portraits | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	So we have the case where the eigenvalues are both complex conjugate, and we have their real part being negative. So basically, we have spirals, asymptotically stable spirals. And the spirals could be either clockwise or counterclockwise.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmzyW1rP-hk#t=217.33s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, I'll follow the book now and some of the notes and the visuals, and called the independent variable-- the dependent variable I'm going to call x now. And, the independent variable is, as usual, time. So, this is going to be, in general, f of t, and I'm going to use it by calculating example, this is the actual f of t I'm going to be using. But, the general problem for a general f of t is to solve this, or at least to find a particular solution. That's what most of the work is, because we already know how from that to get the general solution by adding the solution to the reduced equation, the associated homogeneous equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0_EQLxHcw#t=886.759s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Today, once again, a day of solving no differential equations whatsoever. The topic is a special kind of differential equation, which occurs a lot. It's one in which the right-hand side doesn't have any independent variable in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=0.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Maybe we can make one line out of a proof. To say that it's a solution, what does it mean to say that it's a solution? It means to say that when you plug it in, plug in this constant function, y0, the dy0 dt is equal to f of y0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=504.076s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Let's assume it's a continuous interest rate. All banks nowadays pay interest continuously, the continuous interest rate. So, if that's all there is, and money is growing, you know the differential equation says that the rate at which it grows is equal to r, the interest rate times a principle, the amount that's in the bank at that time. So, that's the differential equation that governs that. Now, that's, of course, the solution is simply an exponential curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=842.28s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Logistic growth says that calling k a constant is unrealistic because the Earth is not filled entirely with people. What stops it from having unlimited growth? Well, the fact that the resources, the food, the organism has to live on gets depleted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=1453.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, these guys don't mean anything physically, but mathematically they exist. Their solutions, they're going down like that. Now, you notice from this picture that there are, even though both of these are constant solutions, they have dramatically different behavior. This one, this solution, is the one that all other solutions try to approach as time goes to infinity. This one, the solution zero, is repulsive, as it were.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=1935.402s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I wonder how long it to do think that one up, semi-stable critical point: stable on one side, unstable on the other depending on whether you start below it. And, of course, it could be reversed if I had drawn the picture the other way. I could have approached it from the top, and left it from below. You get the idea of the behavior. Okay, let's now take, I'm going to soup up this logistic equation just a little bit more. So, let's talk about the logistic equation. But, I'm going to add to it harvesting, with harvesting. So, this is a very late 20th century concept. So, we imagine, for example, a bunch of formerly free range Atlantic salmon penned in one of these huge factory farms off the coast of Maine or someplace. They've made salmon much cheaper than it used to be, but at a certain cost to the salmon, and possibly to our environment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=2140.55s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, this is the initial condition, and this is the first order differential equation. And, as you know, the two of them together are called an IVP, an initial value problem, which means two things, the differential equation and the initial value that you want to start the solution at.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKKzMag5Rc#t=95.0s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Okay, now, the method we are going to talk about, the basic method of which many others are merely refinements in one way or another, is called Euler's method. Euler, who did, of course, everything in analysis, as far as I know, didn't actually use it to compute solutions of differential equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKKzMag5Rc#t=119.18s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The whole difficulty is, this is called a singular point. The solution has a singularity, in other words, a single place where it goes to infinity or becomes discontinuous, maybe as a jump discontinuity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKKzMag5Rc#t=2980.0s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	You would never see something like that but it is okay. What else do you need to know? Well, what would a homogenous system be? A homogenous system is one without these extra guys. That doesn't mean there is no t in it. There could be t in the a, b, c and d, but these terms with no x and y in them must not occur. So, a linear homogenous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=255.039s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And that is the kind we are going to start studying first in the same way when we studied higher order equations. We studied first homogenous. You had to know how to solve those first, and then you could learn how to solve the more general kind. So linear homogenous means that r1 is zero and r2 is zero for all time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=287.0s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Remember what the first order word was? A first order equation where there was no t explicitly on the right-hand side, we called it, anybody remember? Just curious. Autonomous, right. This is an autonomous system. It is not a linear system because these are messy functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=2385.747s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	It is the velocity of the solution at time t. If I think of the solution as being a parameterized motion. All I have drawn here is the trace, the path of the motion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=2633.887s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Stop me. Not enough here. So on and so on. We can say a system of first order equations, ODEs of first order equations, autonomous because there must be no t on the right-hand side, is equal to a velocity field. A field of velocity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=2733.0s
Exploration of the Isoclines Applet	An isocline is the subset of the plane where the slope field takes on a given value. I can choose that value, m, using this slider here. And when I click here and move this, the isocline with the given value of m is drawn in yellow on the screen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxG1iPXznBs#t=131.56s
Exploration of the Isoclines Applet	Now, critical points of a function occur where the derivative is equal to 0. And the derivative is exactly what we know about the solution to a differential equation. So the critical points, the minima or maxima of solutions to this differential equation, occur when the solution crosses the m equals 0 isocline, also known as the nullcline.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxG1iPXznBs#t=284.76s
Exploration of the Isoclines Applet	It's trapped between them. This is called a funnel. It's trapped between these two things, and gets closer and closer, because these two isoclines become asymptotic as x gets large. These are called fences as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxG1iPXznBs#t=469.28s
Exploration of the Isoclines Applet	This special solution-- which doesn't do either of those two behaviors, but continues to exist for all positive values of x and become asymptotic to the square root of x-- this is called the separatrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxG1iPXznBs#t=603.2s
Lec 6 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	In my analysis class, these are some math majors, or graduate engineers in various subjects, and if I say prove such and such using the exponential law, I'm sure to get at least half a dozen e-mails asking me, what's the exponential law? Okay, the exponential law is a to the x times a to the y equals a to the x plus y: the law of exponents.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQJBp6Ym-6A#t=444.563s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, we are talking about first order ODEs. ODE: I'll only use two acronyms. ODE is ordinary differential equations. I think all of MIT knows that, whether they've been taking the course or not. So, we are talking about first-order ODEs, which in standard form, are written, you isolate the derivative of y with respect to, x, let's say, on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side you write everything else. You can't always do this very well, but for today, I'm going to assume that it has been done and it's doable. So, for example, some of the ones that will be considered either today or in the problem set are things like y prime equals x over y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=60.55s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Of course, the differential equation has many solutions containing an arbitrary constant. So, we'll call this the solution. Now, the geometric view, the geometric guy that corresponds to this version of writing the equation, is something called a direction field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=337.243s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Now, the integral curve, so those are the line elements. The integral curve is a curve, which goes through the plane, and at every point is tangent to the line element there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=470.846s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Now, why can't you to have this? That's much more sophisticated than this, and the reason is because of something called the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem, which says that there is through a point, x zero y zero, that y prime equals f of (x, y) has only one, and only one solution. One has one solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=2465.0s
Pole Diagrams | MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011	But now, with f of t equals F_0 cos omega*t, and omega, the circular frequency going between 1 and 5. And the question is for which values of omega do we have the largest response from the system G? So basically, we're looking at phenomenon of resonance where we want to find the frequency omega for which the response of the system is going to be the biggest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUFSXhoazY8#t=452.59s
Part 2: The Big Picture of Linear Algebra	And now, you get to see the big picture of linear algebra, where the four fundamental subspaces do their thing. There you go. You can die happy now. The row spaces there, those are rows of the matrix, independent rows of the matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwLOfdfc4dw#t=280.13s
Part 4: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors	And that makes computations infinitely easier. The hard part of a matrix is all the connections between different rows and columns. So eigenvectors are the guys that stay in that same direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyC3gl6weYo#t=107.06s
Part 6: Finding the Nullspace: Solving Ax = 0 by Elimination	So OK, here are key ideas of the lecture. So the null space-- so now you see it in writing-- the null space is all the solutions x to Ax equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFIaRtKNP2E#t=161.7s
Part 6: Finding the Nullspace: Solving Ax = 0 by Elimination	Well, because the equations are still true at every point. The x's, the null space of a matrix, is not changing by my elimination steps. Yeah. So let's just repeat this. When you finally get to R, when you've done the elimination and you get to R with its identity matrix, that identity matrix in R tells you which columns at the start were independent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFIaRtKNP2E#t=905.43s
Part 6: Finding the Nullspace: Solving Ax = 0 by Elimination	Then P transpose has to come into the solutions. Yeah. Yeah, because P times P transpose. So remember about permutation matrices. Linear algebra is about learning different special character of different matrices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFIaRtKNP2E#t=1371.66s
Lecture 7: Convergent Sequences of Real Numbers	So let's replace it by something simpler. Again, this is analysis, which means we get to use our wits, and try to replace complicated things by simpler things, and work with the simpler things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Ro2zf9hAc#t=2149.41s
Lecture 7: Convergent Sequences of Real Numbers	But in order to study it, it often requires some general machinery, i.e., theorems. So now we'll talk a little bit about sequences obtained from other sequences. So these are called subsequences, or sequences obtained from a single sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Ro2zf9hAc#t=2714.3s
Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers	The fourth is that we have what's called an identity element, an additive identity element. There exists an element which I'll label 0 in the set F such that for all x in F, 0 plus x equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPLLXHZ8_U#t=1897.23s
Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers	So non-negative if x is bigger than or equal to 0, positive x is bigger than 0, and then likewise with negative and non-positive. And so the most basic example, again, is Q. Q is an ordered field with the usual order and with the usual algebraic structure on Q.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPLLXHZ8_U#t=2834.99s
Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers	And there's nothing there. So it's bounded below, then if I look at minus A-- so here, I'm drawing 0. If I look at minus A, which is the set of elements-- the set of the additive inverses of A, I now have a set which is bounded above.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPLLXHZ8_U#t=3699.39s
Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers	You just need to turn it into written word. So there exists a lower bound for A. Let me just note another set called minus-- which I'll label minus A. This is the set of all elements in F of the form minus the additive inverses of A, as a is in capital A. So it's the additive inverse of all elements in capital A. Then the fact that I have for all a in A b is less than or equal to a implies for all a in A, minus a is less than or equal to minus b because multiplying through by minus 1 flips the inequality.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPLLXHZ8_U#t=3936.51s
Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers	We'll talk about Cauchy sequences soon-ish. But I'm more interested in proving properties about R, and then going on to functions on R, limits, which is what analysis is, is the study of limits, rather than get tied up in really non-analytic facts, algebraic facts trying to construct this R, the actual field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPLLXHZ8_U#t=4497.64s
Lecture 4: The Characterization of the Real Numbers	Now, we basically did that a minute ago in the rational numbers. And kind of the same proof works here. So let E be the set of all x's in R such that x is positive and x squared is less than 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPLLXHZ8_U#t=4601.0s
Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers	But it's of fundamental importance in real analysis, which is the triangle inequality, which states that for all xy in R, the absolute value of x plus y is less than or equal to the absolute value of x plus the absolute value of y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnDtMfyZSIE#t=31.68s
Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers	Real analysis is the study of limits that has to deal with real numbers. So let's get to our first notion of a limit. And that is the limit of a sequence of real numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnDtMfyZSIE#t=2587.55s
Lecture 6: The Uncountability of the Real Numbers	OK. So here's another definition. So a sequence is bounded if, in some sense, it doesn't run off to arbitrarily large values. So sequence x sub n is bounded if there exists some real number b bigger than or equal to 0 such that for all n in the natural numbers xn is less than or equal to b in absolute value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnDtMfyZSIE#t=2825.53s
Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So let's continue with our discussion of the derivative. Let me recall that the derivative of a function, if it exists, which we denote by f prime of c, this is the limit as x goes to c of f of x minus f of c over x minus c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Wg_jrMSQY#t=0.0s
Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem	Second is the multiplication rule, which is the function f times g is differentiable at c. And the derivative of the product is not the product of the derivatives, but the prime of c, g of c plus f of c, g prime of c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Wg_jrMSQY#t=314.34s
Lecture 19: Differentiation Rules, Rolle's Theorem, and the Mean Value Theorem	So let xn be c minus-- how did I write this-- delta over 2n, which is in the interval c minus delta c for all n. Then what do we know? xn, the limit as n goes to infinity of c minus delta over 2, n converges to c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Wg_jrMSQY#t=2107.92s
Lecture 25: Power Series and the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem	And you can interpret this, although we never called them Taylor series, as a statement that every power series is the Taylor series of a function. At least in this setting that we're looking at.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4qQ1oIQcW8#t=1662.03s
Lecture 25: Power Series and the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem	So for analytic functions, which are these functions equal to power series, they are the limits of polynomials. But that's a pretty small class of functions, analytic functions. But Weierstrass proved this very interesting result that actually something like this is true for all continuous functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4qQ1oIQcW8#t=1880.7s
Lecture 13: Limits of Functions	But I'm going to leave that to the lecture notes, and we're just going to start on a new topic. So the topic that we're now on is continuous functions. And so continuous functions, as we'll see, is a statement about how a function behaves near a point in relation to how it behaves at the point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeXg5rJ9D8#t=36.76s
Lecture 13: Limits of Functions	What about the point 1? Is that a cluster point of this set? That's a good observation that, yeah, it's a sup of the set. So for every-- right, so for every delta positive, if I draw a little interval around 1, there's going to be a number less than 1 that's bigger than 1 minus delta, right? The set of cluster points of the open interval 0, 1 is the closed interval 0, 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeXg5rJ9D8#t=587.93s
Lecture 13: Limits of Functions	You proved that basically using the squeeze theorem in the definition. All right, so with the notion of a cluster point, these are the points in a set where we're going to start talking about how a function behaves near a point, which is the notion of a limit of a function is our next definition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeXg5rJ9D8#t=1307.58s
Lecture 21: The Riemann Integral of a Continuous Function	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK. So we're going to continue our discussion of-- is it 1M or 2? It's 1. Of the Riemann integral, which, remember, from the discussion at the end of the last lecture, is a theory of area underneath the graph of a function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeYUHA0UMVg#t=0.0s
Lecture 21: The Riemann Integral of a Continuous Function	OK? And so our theory of Riemann integration, or our theory of the area underneath the curve, is built on the following goal, which is to show that, as these partitions get finer and finer, as the norm of these partitions goes to 0, these Riemann sums should converge to some number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeYUHA0UMVg#t=157.16s
Lecture 21: The Riemann Integral of a Continuous Function	So let me first define a useful metric or number associated to-- or function associated to a continuous function called the modulus of continuity. So for f continuous function and eta positive, we define the modulus continuity omega f of eta-- this is equal to the supremum of f of x minus f of y [INAUDIBLE] absolute value, such that the absolute value of x minus y is less than or equal to [? eta. ?] OK? So what does this modulus of continuity measure? It measures, given-- if I take any two points less than or equal to eta in distance, and I look f of x minus f of y in absolute value, and take the sup over all that, that gives me the modulus of continuity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeYUHA0UMVg#t=507.12s
Lecture 21: The Riemann Integral of a Continuous Function	Just like differentiation, the derivative of alpha f plus g if everything's differentiable, is equal to alpha times the derivative of f plus the derivative of g. But Riemann integration, the Riemann integral, or integration in general, is in some sense-- I don't want to say it's not miraculous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeYUHA0UMVg#t=3910.41s
Lecture 22: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Integration by Parts, and Change of Variable Formula	I got to get a different piece of chalk. This one is going psychedelic on me. And then the xi ones are just points chosen in these smaller subintervals. The norm of a partition is the length of the largest subinterval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWZ_CeiRnIo#t=121.853s
Lecture 22: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Integration by Parts, and Change of Variable Formula	And now the Riemann integral is a limit of sums in some sense, and a limit of certain sums involving f. And what? So we do have this relationship involving sums and absolute values with the triangle inequality, which says the absolute value of the sum is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWZ_CeiRnIo#t=1027.67s
Lecture 22: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Integration by Parts, and Change of Variable Formula	All right. So we're going to connect these two things. So in order to even get at this guy, we have to take a partition, a sequence of partitions converging with norm converging to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWZ_CeiRnIo#t=2674.41s
Lecture 22: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Integration by Parts, and Change of Variable Formula	This is the thing I want to show is less than epsilon. Now by additivity, the integral from a to x since x is-- well, the integral from a to x of f is equal to the integral from a to c plus the integral from c to x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWZ_CeiRnIo#t=3430.6s
Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums	The mean value theorem, as it's written, says there exists some point in between so that the secant line from f of b to f of a is equal to the derivative of the function, the tangent to the graph, at some point in between.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImHAGH_OEow#t=1106.41s
Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums	We have the second derivative test, which says the following-- which states that, suppose I have a function from the open interval a, b to R. And suppose this has two continuous derivatives on this open interval a, b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImHAGH_OEow#t=1240.95s
Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums	And I should say that this is a strict relative min. What's the difference between a strict relative min and just a relative min? A strict relative min, I mean that if I'm at any point other than x0 and I'm nearby, then f of x is bigger than f of x0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImHAGH_OEow#t=1318.13s
Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums	It is not, as maybe you're told, somehow magically equal to the area underneath the curve. There is no notion of area underneath the curve. The Riemann integral is a number which you interpret as the area underneath the curve because it agrees with what you think the area underneath the curve should be for simple examples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImHAGH_OEow#t=2023.5s
Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums	For example, a half-circle or just a box. These two notions agree. And therefore, you interpret the Riemann integral, which is a number obtained by a limiting process, as the area underneath the curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImHAGH_OEow#t=2049.61s
Lecture 20: Taylor's Theorem and the Definition of Riemann Sums	The tagged points are just lying in these smaller intervals. And at least in this picture, the biggest separation between partition points would be something like x3 minus x2 here. The norm of a partition is the length of the largest subinterval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImHAGH_OEow#t=2552.26s
Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function	All right. So let's prove the first theorem-- I mean, the first part of this theorem. So what's the intuition? Remember, continuity is a connection between f near a point and the function at the point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smIcuRZybsA#t=374.97s
Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function	Now, what else do I know or what else am I assuming? x sub n is a sequence converging to s. So for large n, for n big enough for some capital M0, x sub n is going to lie inside this interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smIcuRZybsA#t=996.85s
Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function	So we proved this in an assignment. Between any two real numbers, I can find a rational number, an irrational number in between them. So that's what this statement says, is for each n, I can find an irrational number between the number c and the number c plus 1 over n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smIcuRZybsA#t=2415.65s
Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function	So let me write this out real quick. I will say by composition theorem, the function sine x of 4 is continuous, which implies by, I'll say, algebraic theorem, meaning that theorem that involves algebraic operations, 3 plus sine x to the 4 is continuous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smIcuRZybsA#t=3577.39s
Lecture 15: The Continuity of Sine and Cosine and the Many Discontinuities of Dirichlet's Function	And then we'll also prove the intermediate value theorem, which says between any two-- if I have a continuous function on an interval a, b, and I look at f of a and f of b, and I take a number in between those two values, f of a and f of b, there exists a point in between them so that f attains that value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smIcuRZybsA#t=3674.01s
Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series	So what is the definition of a Cauchy sequence? A Cauchy sequence, intuitively, it's a sequence so that if you go far enough out in the sequence, any two entries in that sequence are close together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_w-R_g5lRA#t=86.48s
Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series	So convergent sequences had the property that if you go far enough out, the entries in the sequence are getting close to a real number. Cauchy sequence is that any two entries are close to each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_w-R_g5lRA#t=102.71s
Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series	So a Cauchy sequence, so we say a sequence is Cauchy if we're all epsilon positive, there exists an M, natural number, such that if n is bigger than or equal to M and k is bigger than or equal to M, then xn minus xk is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_w-R_g5lRA#t=118.72s
Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series	Series expansions are how you solve ODEs, PDEs, Taylor expansions. All these things are, in some sense, a form of series. So being able to justify them as being real things is a necessity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_w-R_g5lRA#t=2458.79s
Lecture 10: The Completeness of the Real Numbers and Basic Properties of Infinite Series	So we look at the m-th partial sum-- this is the sum from n equals 1 to m of 1 over n plus 1n. And this is equal to-- now, if I write 1 over n plus 1 times n as 1 over n minus 1 over n plus 1, this is now the sum of 1 over n plus-- these are finite sums, so I can always split them up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_w-R_g5lRA#t=2789.07s
Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction	OK, so that's the basic definition of set, empty set. So set A-- another definition to set A is subset of B, which we write A, this little symbol that looks like a C, B If every element in A is an element in B. Little a's in capital A means little a is in capital B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7YmuDbuW0#t=466.61s
Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction	So this is fine to think about for now. So of course, I didn't have to use these. Maybe I'm interested in odd numbers. That's a set of numbers of the form 2m minus 1, where m is a natural number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7YmuDbuW0#t=849.65s
Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction	OK, so let's get back to sets, to our review of sets. So there were some examples. We have a few more definitions. The union of two sets, A and B, is the set which we write-- so this is how we denote it, A U B. This is the set of all elements x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7YmuDbuW0#t=1015.24s
Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction	x is in A or x is in B. The intersection of A and B-- so this was defining the union. This was defining the intersection-- is the set A cap B. And this is a set of all x's so that x is in A and x is in B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7YmuDbuW0#t=1054.671s
Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction	The set difference of A with respect to B is the set A backslash B. This is the set of all elements in A such that x is not in B. The complement of A is the set A-- so this is how I'm denoting the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7YmuDbuW0#t=1119.05s
Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction	The next part is how I'm defining the set. This is a set of all elements in our universe that is not in A. And when I say universe, I don't mean this universe necessarily.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7YmuDbuW0#t=1171.86s
Lecture 14: Limits of Functions in Terms of Sequences and Continuity	It cares about what the function is doing near the point. Now we're going to discuss the notion of continuity, which connects the limit of a function at a point to the function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBESL68iX6s#t=2797.235s
Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions	In fact, for those of you who've taken quantum mechanics, which I mean, you don't have to. But or you heard of something called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which says something like something to the effect that you cannot measure the position of a particle and its momentum to arbitrarily good degree, you're bound by if you can measure the position of a particle very well, then your measurement of the momentum is going to be not so great and vice versa.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRTdXJgZ0Q#t=99.56s
Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions	First off, when we computed these formulas-- formulae, I guess-- we interchanged summation, infinite summation of functions with integration. When can we do that? In what sense does if this Fourier series converges, in what sense does it converge to f? For convergence of real numbers, there was just one sense of the convergence of real numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRTdXJgZ0Q#t=1535.54s
Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions	It's because I didn't think they belonged anywhere until we got to sequences of functions. So a power series about a point x0 is a series of the form sum from j equals 0 to infinity of a sub j, x minus x0 to the j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRTdXJgZ0Q#t=1711.34s
Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions	And meaning rho equals infinity. And this is how we define the exponential function. Exponential function, exponential of x to be what comes out of this series. And then, simply from this definition, you can show things that an exponential function should satisfy, x e to the n is equal to n e to the e of 1 to the n-th power, and so on, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRTdXJgZ0Q#t=2134.39s
Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions	That gives me a sequence of numbers. And point-wise convergence says that sequence of numbers converges to f of x. For each x, I get a sequence of numbers, which converges to f of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRTdXJgZ0Q#t=3624.57s
Lecture 23: Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Sequences of Functions	So choose M to be this M0, the M that is for this epsilon. Then for all n bigger than or equal to M, let's call this equation star, star with at the single point x equals at c, implies fn of c minus f of c is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRTdXJgZ0Q#t=3958.22s
Lecture 8: The Squeeze Theorem and Operations Involving Convergent Sequences	The distance from two numbers a and b is the absolute value of a minus b. Or the distance from a number to 0 is just the absolute value of that number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os_XGBNPllM#t=4063.78s
Lecture 8: The Squeeze Theorem and Operations Involving Convergent Sequences	But you should know it. So this theorem is the reverse triangle inequality which states for all a, b real number, the absolute value of the difference in absolute values is less than or equal to the absolute value of the difference.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os_XGBNPllM#t=4257.858s
Lecture 16: The Min/Max Theorem and Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem	But this was the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent sub-sequence. And we're going to use these two theorems today and in the next lecture to prove that a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval is very well-behaved.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUKdwHRSD8#t=111.61s
Lecture 16: The Min/Max Theorem and Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem	So let me just recall what it means for a function to be bounded. We say that a function from a subset S to R is bounded. So here, S is a subset of R-- is bounded if there exists a non-negative B such that for all x and S, f of x is bigger than or equal to B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUKdwHRSD8#t=299.052s
Lecture 16: The Min/Max Theorem and Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem	So if a bounded function is supposed to have a graph bounded between two real numbers, an unbounded one is one in which at least part of the graph is going off to plus infinity or minus infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUKdwHRSD8#t=456.65s
Lecture 16: The Min/Max Theorem and Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem	So let f be a function from S to R. S is a non-empty subset of R. We say, f achieves an absolute max. Let me write it this way-- an absolute min at c in S if f of c sits below f of x for all x in S. If for all x in S, f of c is less than or equal to f of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUKdwHRSD8#t=1234.34s
Lecture 11: Absolute Convergence and the Comparison Test for Series	And the answer to this question is no. So what's the counterexample? It's the so-called harmonic series, which corresponds to our favorite sequence which converges to 0. So we'll state this as a theorem-- the series sum from n equals 1 to infinity of 1 over n does not converge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSp9nIFnbo#t=82.52s
Lecture 11: Absolute Convergence and the Comparison Test for Series	What do we do? We find a dyadic number, a number of the form 2 to the k bigger than m. And since 2 to the m is bigger than m-- I think that's maybe one of the first things we did by induction-- we get that s sub m-- which is the partial sum of non-negative terms-- this is going to be less than or equal to, since this is a monotone increasing guy, this is going to be less than or equal s to the 2m, which is less than or equal to 1 plus 1 minus 2 to the minus p minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSp9nIFnbo#t=3525.17s
Lecture 24: Uniform Convergence, the Weierstrass M-Test, and Interchanging Limits	So we have a sequence of functions, f n from some set S to R, another function, fixed function f from S to R. And then we say f n converges to f pointwise if for every x in S, the sequence of real numbers converges to f of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXPX29KfEc4#t=41.59s
Lecture 24: Uniform Convergence, the Weierstrass M-Test, and Interchanging Limits	Let's call f equals 0, but g is not equal to f prime. The derivative of f, the constant function 0, which is 0. g is equal to this function, which is 0 if x is in 0, 1 and 1 if x is equal to 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXPX29KfEc4#t=2457.22s
Lecture 5: The Archimedian Property, Density of the Rationals, and Absolute Value	An ordered field also this set has an order on it. And this order interacts with the operations of addition and multiplication in natural ways. And the least upper bound property means every non-empty subset which is bounded above has a supremum in the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2d4HsBsu8Y#t=72.85s
Lecture 5: The Archimedian Property, Density of the Rationals, and Absolute Value	So least upper bound property, meaning the supremum belongs in R, not necessarily in the non-empty set, which is bounded above. And we saw last time that q, the rational numbers, does not have this property.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2d4HsBsu8Y#t=104.73s
Lecture 5: The Archimedian Property, Density of the Rationals, and Absolute Value	I mean, again, these properties should not be surprising to you. You should know all of them. But we're trying to get familiar-- that's a tough word to say-- familiarities, or familiarity with proofs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2d4HsBsu8Y#t=3618.74s
Lecture 5: The Archimedian Property, Density of the Rationals, and Absolute Value	The fifth property is, if x and y is in R, then x is less than or equal to y if and only if minus y is less than or equal to x is less than or equal to y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2d4HsBsu8Y#t=3710.134s
Lecture 5: The Archimedian Property, Density of the Rationals, and Absolute Value	And it states for all xy in R, the absolute value of x plus y is less than or equal to the absolute value of x plus the absolute value of y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2d4HsBsu8Y#t=4620.95s
Lecture 18: Weierstrass's Example of a Continuous and Nowhere Differentiable Function	Remember, this is not changing within. It's just fixed. It depended only on epsilon. So m0 is fixed. And this is less than or equal to lim sup of int. Now we use what we know about cosine, that cosine of something minus cosine of something else is bounded by the difference in the argument.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRJ9IgUW-M#t=2958.25s
Lecture 18: Weierstrass's Example of a Continuous and Nowhere Differentiable Function	So somehow this function is highly oscillatory at every scale. And if you have a function which is highly oscillatory of every scale, if some of you have heard of Brownian motion, which is a function which is-- I mean, which is a path which is highly oscillatory, then that function will not be differentiable anywhere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRJ9IgUW-M#t=3315.66s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	So let A be a set. First, we can show that the cardinality of A is less than or equal to the cardinality of the power set of A. So we need to find an injection, a one-to-one map from A into the power set of A. And the simplest one to choose is one that takes an element of A to the set containing just that element.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=253.93s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	Remember, a bijective function means that G is one to one and onto. One to one meaning different things of A gets mapped to different things of the power set. Onto means everything in the power set gets mapped onto from A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=516.409s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	So really, the fact that it's surjective is the only thing I'm going to use. And I'm going to define a weird set. And we're going to look at this set. So define a set B. And this is a subset of A. B is a set of all x's in A such that x is not in f of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=535.13s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	Now, we call an element in S the least upper bound for E if it satisfies two conditions. One is, if there's a least upper bound, there should at least be an upper bound.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=2261.96s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	And so there's some Latin name attached to least upper bound, so there's a Latin name attached to the greatest lower bound, which we call the infimum. We also call b0 the infimum of E. And we write b0 equals inf E.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=2468.2s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	But then so would be minus 2, minus 3, and so on. But the greatest lower bound would be minus 1. Now let's do another example. Let's now look at S, the rational numbers, and let's take E to be a set of rational numbers such that 0 is bigger than or equal to-- Q is between 0 and 1 inclusive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=2659.54s
Lecture 3: Cantor's Remarkable Theorem and the Rationals' Lack of the Least Upper Bound Property	This is not meant to mean anything always. This is a label, which is the set of elements minus x. So I take all my elements in E, which is a subset of the negative integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbENJ-Ce7Nc#t=3392.55s
Lecture 17: Uniform Continuity and the Definition of the Derivative	CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So last time we finished by proving Bolzano's intermediate value theorem, which states that a continuous function achieves all values in between the function evaluated at the endpoint. So if I have a continuous function, neither-- I take a value y between f of a and f of b, so either f of a is less than f of b and y's in between is bigger than f of a and less than f of b, or f of a is bigger than f of b, but y is still in between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_sNWn7zujU#t=12.76s
Lecture 17: Uniform Continuity and the Definition of the Derivative	Continuity, remember, says if I fix a point, then as long as I'm close to that point, the outputs will be close to each other. Uniform says, no matter what two points you choose, as long as they're close together, the outputs will be close together in a controlled way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_sNWn7zujU#t=1880.9s
Lecture 17: Uniform Continuity and the Definition of the Derivative	If this limit exists, we say the functions differentiable at c, and we use a notation f prime f apostrophe c for this limit. If f is differentiable at every point of the interval I, we'd get a new function, this function f prime of c, which we denote the function that's a derivative of f as f prime or dfdx.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_sNWn7zujU#t=3783.91s
Lecture 9: Limsup, Liminf, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem	And then we also had the squeeze theorem, that if you have two-- if you have three sequences-- a sub n, b sub n, and x sub n-- so that x sub n is in between a sub n and b sub n, and the a sub n and b sub n converge to the same thing, then the sequence x sub n converges, and it converges to the [? common ?] limit of a sub n and b sub n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn8wL2ItzZw#t=32.34s
Lecture 9: Limsup, Liminf, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem	OK. And so before I prove this, this immediately gives the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which is that every bounded sequence has a convergence subsequence. OK. So again, this follows immediately from the previous theorem, because if I take a bounded sequence, by the previous theorem, I can find a subsequence which converges to the limsup, which always exists for a bounded sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn8wL2ItzZw#t=3046.67s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	It's a subset of A. And this is a subset of B. This is-- let me write it slightly differently here. This is a set of all y in B such that there exists an x in C such that y equals to f of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=469.89s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	So this inverse image of the set D always exists. This is the set of all elements in A such that f of x is in D. So for example, let me-- so 1, 2, 3, 4 and a, b, c, d.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=544.92s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	It should be read one-to-one if f satisfies the following property. f of x1 equals f of x2 implies x1 equals x2. So injective, or one-to-one, means if I take two different inputs, I get two different outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=741.305s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	So bijections, meaning bijective functions, will be what we mean when we say two sets can be paired off. It's what we mean when we-- or at least what Cantor's answer to that original question was, when did two sets have the same size.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=1239.89s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	For example, that first map we wrote up there, that says that the set 1, 2, 3 in size is less than or equal to the size of a, b, c, d because we found an injection, an injective map from the first set to the second set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=1550.5s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	So this theorem that I'm stating here is the Cantor Schroeder Bernstein theorem, which states that if the size of A is less than or equal to the size of B and the size of B is less than or equal to the size of A, then the size of A equals the size of B. So again, if you're thinking of these in the context of real numbers, one being less than or equal to the other and vice versa, of course, that implies that those two real numbers are equal to each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=1742.45s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	So finite sets are sets that you can count if you had n fingers. Now, we would like to be able to define what it means to be able to count a set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=1829.9s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	We say A is countable. So countably infinite means I need all the natural numbers to be able to count off the elements of the set A. Countable means maybe I stop after some point and I've counted all them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=1950.45s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	I will at least give you an idea of how the proof will go, what we will actually be able to write down, a map based on a simple fact. So let me not write down proof, but let me write down a remark.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=3829.41s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	So just try to follow along. So the fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that if you have a positive natural number, you can write it in a unique way as a product of prime numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=3869.67s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	If A is a set, we define script p of A. This is the power set of A. This is a set that consists of all subsets of A. So this is a set of all sets B such that B is a subset of A. So for example, if A is the empty set, the power set-- so A is empty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=4665.71s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	If A equals 1, then the power set of A, the set of all subsets, consists of the empty set and the set itself, 1. And let's do one more. If A is the set 1, 2, then the power set of A, this is the set which consists of the empty set, because this is a subset of this set, the set consisting of 1, because this is a subset of this set, or 2, 1, 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=4733.73s
Lecture 2: Cantor's Theory of Cardinality (Size)	And you can prove by induction, if you like, that 2 to the n is always bigger than n. And so a theorem I'll prove next time, which will finish our discussion of sets and cardinality, and then we'll move on to the real numbers, is this theorem due to Cantor, which says that not just for finite sets do we have the power set being, in some sense, strictly bigger than the original set, but for any set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_xG0AGRa-w#t=4851.85s
Snowball Earth and hysteresis | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 22	So let me just grab it over here. So this is a-- I guess this is an artist's picture because we humans have never experienced a Snowball Earth. But the Snowball Earth refers to ice covering the Earth from the poles to the equator and back again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIgr_2nUvI#t=344.19s
Snowball Earth and hysteresis | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 22	So that the sign, or in math sometimes you see it being called signum, which is nothing more than the Latin for sign, is a function that on the real numbers, it's 1 for a positive number and minus 1 for a negative number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIgr_2nUvI#t=442.34s
Snowball Earth and hysteresis | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 22	And while I'm at it, I'm actually interested in the roots. So let's just do it here before I forget. So a root of a function is where this function is 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIgr_2nUvI#t=723.04s
Snowball Earth and hysteresis | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 22	So this is basically the phenomenon of hysteresis. And I'll give you the official word, that the official definition is if the dependence of the state of a system depends on its history, that the state of the system cared about where you came from, then this is known as hysteresis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIgr_2nUvI#t=1851.17s
Snowball Earth and hysteresis | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 22	Let's put all this stuff back in. All right, that's better. OK, so let's go back to the past when the-- back when the sun, the solar insolation, the amount of power from the sun was here, below, where we are today.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIgr_2nUvI#t=2764.45s
Linear models and simulations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 15	OK, so this is the theoretical line. And here, I plot it with these red dots, the noisy data. And I also made the best fit line, the least-squares line that fits through this data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6NTKsR8TjQ#t=560.55s
Linear models and simulations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 15	And then I'm going to throw in a noise estimate, which is the sum of squares divided by n minus 2 for various reasons. OK, and so here, you see I get the same number, the b estimate is the same number of computed by linear algebra, the m estimate is the same number computed by the linear algebra formula.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6NTKsR8TjQ#t=1230.75s
Linear models and simulations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 15	What's the relevance of a 0 coefficient? A 0 coefficient means that there's no dependence. For example, a 0 here means there's no dependence on Fahrenheit. A 0 here means there's no intercept at all.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6NTKsR8TjQ#t=2895.69s
Random walks II | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 13	It's just the sum of those random variables, which you could write with a sigma notation. And so, again, what do we mean by the sum? We mean a new random variable which-- whose outcomes are the sums of the outcomes of the random variables that we put in.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIAFHyLmwbM#t=1812.31s
Random walks II | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 13	They're correlated. As in, they're no longer independent. So that makes it actually harder to generate samples from this object. It's a more complicated object because actually what we need is, indeed, what's called the whole trajectory of this random walk, which is the sequence of positions at each time step.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIAFHyLmwbM#t=1888.7s
Random walks II | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 13	When it bounces off its reflecting boundary. And what we're doing here is called an absorbing boundary. So we're just setting the value there to 0, the value of the probability and that actually corresponds to probability leaking out of the system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIAFHyLmwbM#t=3429.57s
Why can't we predict the weather? | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 19	Yes, exactly so today we're going to start with that process. So we'll look at and actually what we're really looking at is the subject that some people call nonlinear dynamics or dynamical systems, where we take in all a different equation and instead of trying to really study exactly what each trajectory does, if you start at a particular initial commission, we're trying to get a more global qualitative picture and say what kind of behavior can we find? What kinds of things can the system end up doing? As it will look at in particular stability and bifurcation, so we'll see what that means.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3udLzIHtsc#t=833.4s
Why can't we predict the weather? | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 19	Instead of what will happen is there's a maximum number of bacteria that can exist on this plate, which is called the carrying capacity. And that's often written as this capital K.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3udLzIHtsc#t=1024.367s
Why can't we predict the weather? | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 19	And the answer is Yes. So in order to do that, we're going to think of what's called the state space of the system, the space of all possible states or all possible states are just all real numbers between minus infinity and infinity that's what the value that the system can take.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3udLzIHtsc#t=1538.26s
Random variables as types | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 11	This is an idea straight out of probability. A random variable is an object which has different outcomes. For discrete random variable, we assign probabilities. The probability that the random variable X will equal the value x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKAO38UsXo0#t=259.99s
Random variables as types | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 11	And if you're doing experimentally by sampling, we call it the histogram. If it's theoretical, we call it the probability distribution. Sometimes the histogram is called an empirical distribution because it's like an experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKAO38UsXo0#t=825.08s
Random variables as types | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 11	The sum command applies to a collection of objects. So we've defined plus, but we didn't find sum. OK but Julia knows what a sum is. A sum is a sequence of pluses.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKAO38UsXo0#t=2292.37s
Inverses and Newton method | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 5	So let's bring that back over here. So now, I want to talk about inverse functions, OK? So inverse functions. So an inverse function, is a mathematical definition says that if you have f of some function, it could be from 2-vectors to 2-vectors, but that's not particularly important.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjcx9sNSLP8#t=1255.44s
Inverses and Newton method | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 5	And then we define the inverse of a function as this normal function taking y to the inverse of f evaluated at the point y. And that is exactly what Alan showed actually applying to the images.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjcx9sNSLP8#t=3415.56s
Transformations 2: Composability and Linearity | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 4	And these two combined, you actually can combine them into one thing. And this is the usual mathematical definition. We say that-- we call this a linear combination, as we saw in an earlier lecture, we say that a transform of a linear combination is the same linear combination of the transforms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDPf3RjoCpY#t=3174.7s
How to collaborate on software | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 21	They can find the code they can change it. And they can do what's called a pull request, which means they suggest some changes to the project itself. And then I can accept those maybe communicate about them or reject them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N9Vvc8amGM#t=99.05s
How to collaborate on software | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 21	So the commits and there is a bit of terminology here, right? But a commit is a set of changes to files. And essentially, it get to the repository as it starts out from an empty folder.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N9Vvc8amGM#t=1628.99s
How to collaborate on software | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 21	Diff meaning the differences. Right. The set of different, the collection of differences between the clients. You have this friends.txt on the web. You have this friends.txt as it exists at this very moment in time, and it's just going to do a pure comparison and you've got that extra i.e.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N9Vvc8amGM#t=2897.725s
Sampling and random variables | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 9	So let's start off by looking at a few of the Julia-- just summarizing a few of the pieces of Julia that we're going to see today. There are a couple of functions like sum, which takes the sum of a collection.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HrpoFZzITI#t=34.14s
Sampling and random variables | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 9	So there's a default here, which is actually float 64, and so it's going to give us a random number between 0 and 1. A random real number. Or rather, a random floating point number with 64 bits of precision.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HrpoFZzITI#t=427.78s
Sampling and random variables | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 9	So what we're doing here, what we've been doing is what's called uniform sampling. So what do we mean by uniform? We mean that each possible object that we're choosing from has the same probability as the other ones.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HrpoFZzITI#t=934.79s
Sampling and random variables | MIT Computational Thinking Spring | Lecture 9	And there's some output, and the value of that output is one of the possible values of this object called a random variable. And then what we are interested in is the probability that that random variable object takes each possible outcome, and that set of correspondences between the possible outcomes and the probability of those outcomes is what we'll call the distribution, the probability distribution of that random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HrpoFZzITI#t=1834.5s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	And so that's why we created MARGO, which stands for Mitigation, Adaptation, Removal, Geoengineering, Optimization. And so we'll sort of see an example of it today. But really the idea was to sort of boil down all of the essentials into one small interpretable model that was up in source and that's never really been done.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=127.69s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	Now there's this Paris Climate Agreement, which is a global agreement that countries want to keep the temperature below 2 degrees C, and to get there we need to decrease our CO2 emissions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=481.89s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	And you can do that either by planting trees in a sort of more natural way or changing soil treatments, or you can suck it out with sort of engineering chemical processes, which is called direct air capture.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=701.81s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	And so you talk about putting this blanket over the planet. Greenhouse gases are literally trapping outgoing heat and warming the planet, and so you have this simple radiative forcing function which is the greenhouse effect.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=743.7s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	OK, so David, if you're ready? Yeah, I'm ready. All right, so David will talk a bit about JuMP, which is a Julia package that let you do an optimization process and specifically constrained optimization.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=1565.91s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	So so far we've been looking at what's called a forward problem where we have a model that tells us what happens say in time and we are giving inputs and the model tells us what the output will be for those inputs so that's why it's called a forward problem we're sort of moving forward from the inputs and outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=1632.51s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	And those programs are called solvers because they're literally doing a solve, they're solving the optimization problem. And so they do that by using various optimization algorithms and in fact a solver often will have several or many different algorithms and that will basically try and choose with some heuristics, it will try to choose which optimization method it will use on a given problem given its characteristics.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=1830.7s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	And I can also get the objective value, which is the value of the function there. So let's do that. So I need the objective value as well. By the way, so this let block is sort of making a little scope, a little mini-program and then I can return things from there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=2239.33s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	You can see that this, as Alan said, that is really terrible. And kind of keeps redrawing everything. This parabola, which is this intersection of the plane, vertical plane with this paraboloid is-- chain is moving, and JuMP is finding the lowest point along that intersection of this function that I'm optimizing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=2805.49s
Modeling climate change | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 25	So, for example, you can look at the physical assumptions. So one of the things that climate scientists care a lot about is the climate sensitivity, which is how much warming do you get for a given amount of CO2? Or say a doubling of CO2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm86_hDwYTU#t=3282.8s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	And that something is going to be just another vector. And we'll talk about aliasing of memory, which is when two different names points to the same place in memory and the cumsum function, which is for cumulative sums.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=540.95s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	And that's actually called Brownian motion. So the original physical-- the physical discovery by Brown in 1827 of pollen grains moving around under a microscope and seemingly at random. That physical process is called Brownian motion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=590.76s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	And then mathematicians have developed this theory of these processes, where you take this limit, the limit of the size of these grid cells to 0. And you get this random process that has also been named Brownian motion or the Wiener process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=608.27s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	We just had-- we modeled radioactive decay or recovery of individuals. They just had a state that was on or off. Now we actually have a state, a sort of internal variable for each object that is a position in space that can change all the time and can become arbitrarily big in an either positive or negative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=679.73s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	And so this is a very different situation. You have, really, two variables, space and time. So we'll-- Let's look at the simplest possible version which is called literally simple random walk, where we just take values plus or minus 1 at each step on the real line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=706.56s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	We made abstract an abstract type, which was random variable. I'm going to make an abstract type which is Walker. And I'm going to assume that any Walker has something inside called position.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=2155.38s
Random walks | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 12	And then I would have been able to change it. So let's just try that. So let's make a mutable struct called a MutableWalker. Now if I make a walker called w2, which is mutable, And I make his value 0, now I can reach inside and sort of manipulate its internal organs and change its value to minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLQ1l75jSwU#t=2311.2s
Time stepping and differential equations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 17	And where N at time 0 is the initial number N sub 0. So this is a differential equation, an ordinary differential equation. What? Is a differential equation is an equation that relates a function to one or more of its derivatives.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y5gVyO8KcI#t=1765.54s
Time stepping and differential equations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 17	So again we're going to look at the change and the number of infectious people after each day. So that will call capital delta it which is capital It plus 1 minus capital t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y5gVyO8KcI#t=2546.31s
Time stepping and differential equations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 17	And since almost all models are not linear or interesting models are non-linear we can say basically you can never write down an analytical solution. And in fact non-linearity often also leads to chaos, chaotic dynamics that we probably won't have time to talk about unfortunately in the course.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y5gVyO8KcI#t=2906.4s
Time stepping and differential equations | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 17	As similarly so that's s is decreasing due to this infection dynamics. I is increasing the number of infectious people increases in the same way. And then we have this recovery process where each individual independently decides to recover at each time step with some other rate gamma and the number of recovered people changes just due to that process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y5gVyO8KcI#t=3266.0s
Dynamic Programming and Seam Carving | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 6	What's happening is that with each step as we're making the image smaller the algorithm decides on a seam to remove from the image. So this is a set of pixels where there's one pixel per row that forms this continuous path from the top to the bottom and it has to somehow decide what path is the one that's most OK to get rid of.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyBXJV1zFlo#t=1583.72s
Dynamic Programming and Seam Carving | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 6	Now in the last lecture-- Alan you can't mute yourself. Alan we've lost sound. Alan can you hear me? [KEYBOARD CLANKING] [INAUDIBLE] is something that produces positive values wherever the blob image was fading from bright towards darker and the negative values where it was fading from dark towards bright.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyBXJV1zFlo#t=1684.56s
Dynamic Programming and Seam Carving | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 6	And any of you familiar with multivariable calculus might find this very familiar notion it's something known as the gradient where if you have a vector that has an x component telling you how much a value changes as you move from the left to the right, which we might call the partial derivative with respect to x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyBXJV1zFlo#t=2036.84s
Dynamic Programming and Seam Carving | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 6	So we might add on the difference between E and D and potentially divide the whole thing by two or average it, it doesn't really matter. In absolute terms all we care about at the end is the relative terms what's the relative change around one pixel compared to the amount of change around another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyBXJV1zFlo#t=2162.08s
Dynamic Programming and Seam Carving | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 6	After it looks through all of them and did all of these computations, it sniffed out the one that was in fact total energy 0.6. So that's what we might call the dynamic programming approach where it's keeping track of values on the way not having to redo computations and let's see what it looks like in the context of our notebook.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyBXJV1zFlo#t=2792.613s
Libraries & parameterized types | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 18	This is an equation that relates the function you to its derivative it is basically tells us that we're at a certain time and we're at a certain position in space it tells us how we can move from that position which direction we need to move in so we're going to move a little bit in that direction and then as soon as we move a little bit this equation tells us that actually the direction that we move needs to change of it is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S71YIZ8e7MQ#t=573.45s
Transformations & AutoDiff | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 3	But I hope certainly, that this numerical thing makes the idea of a gradient more intuitive and what's happening left and right these days is machine learning or some other optimization context, where everybody wants to optimize scalar functions of many parameters.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAREeuaKCic#t=1813.45s
Transformations & AutoDiff | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 3	And now for the big boys and girls, let's go vector in and vector out. That's where the action is, right? So vector valued functions, vector valued multivariate functions. So what goes in is a vector and what goes out is a vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAREeuaKCic#t=1895.62s
Transformations & AutoDiff | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 3	Scale x alpha is a function that takes a vector and scales that vector by alpha in the x direction. And of course, scale why alpha is another function. This is a function where it's not the value of a function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAREeuaKCic#t=1980.58s
Transformations & AutoDiff | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 3	OK, but no worries. We now know what to do. We can define the function to be the anonymous function that takes a vector and applies the thing we just defined. And does it at the point that we want to do it at, right? So you put x and y twice because in this case, it actually defines the r and then here it applies it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAREeuaKCic#t=2334.67s
Advection and diffusion: PDEs in 1D | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 23	And if there's ice, then the albedo, the reflectivity there is going to be higher than the equator. And so everything suddenly becomes not only a function of time, but also of space, of position.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-iUwXI78A#t=295.32s
Advection and diffusion: PDEs in 1D | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 23	And what we're now going to do is see how that changes in time. And so it's going to change in time due to these two effects, advection which means that the temperature is going to be carried along by a fluid.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-iUwXI78A#t=579.46s
Advection and diffusion: PDEs in 1D | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 23	And we need to just calculate how much heat enters and how much heat leaves. And so as we were saying, the heat enters is the amount of heat that is living currently that is currently at within a distance U the velocity of the fluid times delta t, the time step from the boundary of one cell.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-iUwXI78A#t=1538.94s
Transforming Images , MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 2	And again you might find something else. So I looked this up and I found out that there was something on the internet that applies to humans. It's called the face inversion effect where, and I just learned this I mean I'm just reading-- I'm reading Wikipedia like anybody would.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZYVjDDZW9A#t=1035.42s
Transforming Images , MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 2	It's a discrete slope. It wants to be like a derivative. OK, more about that later as well. All right, so this is the gradient in x. The gradient in y is just you flip it on the side, this is called the transpose operator, the apostrophe, it transposes on the side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZYVjDDZW9A#t=2017.34s
Course Welcome + Intro to Arrays & Images! MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 1	So usually, when I think of computer scientists, I can't help but think of people who their first algorithm is sorting. Sorting is the big algorithm, the big poster child for an algorithm in computer science.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zTO3LEY-cM#t=703.35s
Structure | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 7	Here's an example of a one-hot vector. This is a vector that's made up of zeros and ones, but only one of the elements is hot. The rest are cold. OK. So what that means is exactly one element is 1 and the rest are all 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZrVxbmX218#t=252.71s
Structure | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 7	So what's a first matrix? So a sparse matrix is, let's look at the official definition, a matrix that has many zeros worth storing in a sparse structure. And I'm going to tell you what that means in a minute.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZrVxbmX218#t=1009.95s
Structure | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 7	That sort of in the background of all of these questions. OK, so now what about-- so there, I took to rank 1 matrices and I added them together. So again, rank 1, the rank is how many multiplication tables or outer products do I need to add to exactly reconstruct the matrix? That's called the rank.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZrVxbmX218#t=2778.09s
Structure | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 7	And really what we're thinking of is, Oh, actually, I'm getting some data in a table from somewhere, which we'll call a data matrix. So let's just take two rows of the image and think of that as some data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZrVxbmX218#t=2954.925s
Structure | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 7	| so they lie on a straight line, y equals that number of times x. And then the noise image, I'm adding noise to basically the x and y-coordinates. And that spreads out slightly into this blue set of data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZrVxbmX218#t=3144.045s
A first climate model | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 20	But what I've decided is to start off. And I wanted to talk about what I see as computational thinking, where we use the computer to understand the math as opposed to the other way around.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1UsMa1cTeE#t=359.67s
A first climate model | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 20	And this function is typically written as a function of y, parameters p, and time t. And then you call Julia's ODE problem, where you give the initial condition, the time you want it over, and the parameters, if any.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1UsMa1cTeE#t=749.163s
A first climate model | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 20	0 dimensional model means that we just think of the Earth as one point, like the average temperature. There's no difference between Boston and the Middle East or something. There's just-- it's all been averaged out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1UsMa1cTeE#t=1447.8s
A first climate model | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 20	So basically, the three increasingly complicated differential equations that I showed you, they're going to be three effects that we will concentrate on. One is simply the absorbed solar radiation, the energy that comes directly from the sun's rays.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1UsMa1cTeE#t=1466.4s
A first climate model | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 20	It's not staying with us on Earth. And then there's what's causing all the trouble these days, the human-caused greenhouse effects, the trapped outgoing radiation. Because we have carbon dioxide, and methane, and lots of other things that are causing trouble up in the atmosphere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1UsMa1cTeE#t=1501.29s
A first climate model | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 20	They would play with these Bs and Cs parameters. Not by hand, but probably with the minimization, a least squares minimization operation. And they would try to possibly see if they can get a better fit to the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1UsMa1cTeE#t=3127.69s
Resistors, stencils and climate models | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 24	So a resistor is something you put in a circuit and just like it sounds, it resists the flow of electricity. And these are exactly what they look like, these little bands, these colored bands are color coded to tell you stuff like how much resistance it has, I think.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTWgBlDgr0#t=349.49s
Resistors, stencils and climate models | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 24	So you see I'm using Ohm's law. Basically, it's saying that the drop in voltage, the difference in voltage from here to here, is going to be the current times the resistance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTWgBlDgr0#t=423.74s
Resistors, stencils and climate models | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 24	And even to this day, this is the basic idea for how weather and climate models work. Except instead of human computers, we now have supercomputers, numerical computers. Let me then move on, if I may, to actually, a good place here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTWgBlDgr0#t=2156.51s
Resistors, stencils and climate models | MIT Computational Thinking Spring 2021 | Lecture 24	And so in particular, to qualify for submitting your climate model, your model has to be able to run each of these standard deck experiments. And so I'll just go through a couple of those, one is an AMIP experiment, which is where you just run your atmosphere part of your model and just basically set what the ocean temperature is, so you don't have to couple it to an ocean model, and then just run forward from 1979 to 2014.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTWgBlDgr0#t=2352.24s
Principal Component Analysis | MIT Computational Thinking | Spring 2021 | Lecture 8	So we call that an outlier. That doesn't really belong to the data and there was some measurement error or there was some error in transmission of the data or something. Or it might even be a real data point, actually.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuKrM_NzxCk#t=735.51s
Principal Component Analysis | MIT Computational Thinking | Spring 2021 | Lecture 8	And then we add noise to that, I'll get a fat plate, thick plane. That was nice visualization of that, but somehow disappeared. Sorry. Yeah. So what is the singular value decomposition? So that is the mathematical or numerical technique algorithm that enables us to actually calculate this whole information that we just did of spanning all of these angles in two dimensions and to work out which the important directions are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuKrM_NzxCk#t=2224.61s
Principal Component Analysis | MIT Computational Thinking | Spring 2021 | Lecture 8	And these matrices have a particular structure. U and V are orthogonal matrices, which means they are rotations and/or reflections. And sigma is a diagonal matrix with just numbers just on the diagonal, which are called the singular values, which are the stretch factors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuKrM_NzxCk#t=2323.33s
5. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (II)	And it's basically the idea of multijunction cells which are cells that work, and in fact, the highest efficiency solar cells to date are multijunction, triple-junction solar cells. Where basically, you have different band gaps together, and those different band gaps do exactly what you say.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8yyEHm_jI#t=3516.8s
5. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (II)	OK? That's just stationary-- that's just telling you that the change in the concentration of cis is the same. It's like a reaction kinetics equation, the rate of going from one state to another times the number in that state equals the same as the other way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8yyEHm_jI#t=4656.77s
4. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (I)	OK, so any questions about Born-Oppenheimer, the Born-Oppenheimer surface? You'll hear people say that, the Born-Oppenheimer surface, and now you know what they mean. They mean the energy surface where the electrons are always in sort of their ground state with respect to the nuclei positions because they always have enough time to get there because they move so much faster than the nuclei.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5zt5u-C_uY#t=469.97s
4. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (I)	But you hope that you don't change it so much that it's wrong or that it's unphysical, right? And density functional theory effectively is a theory that simplifies H, the Hamiltonian, the expression for the energy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5zt5u-C_uY#t=787.44s
4. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (I)	That's where DFT is. That's why it's so powerful. Any questions? And right, I'm not going to review. I just kind of went through this. The approximation is to work with the density, and you sort of throw everything into a density formalism, and you punt on the exchange-- on this interaction term that's all about this V. So density functional theory is about what functional you use to capture these many-body effects in a single-particle way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5zt5u-C_uY#t=1300.31s
4. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (I)	My total energy of this water molecule is 2,056.56 electronvolts. Yes? AUDIENCE: What's a basis set? JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah. So a basis set is those functions that the computer needs to represent the wave functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5zt5u-C_uY#t=2039.05s
4. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (I)	So a doublet is when I have one more pointing up or down, and a triplet is when I have two extra electrons pointing up or down. Doesn't matter. So this is actually-- the oxygen atom is a triplet.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5zt5u-C_uY#t=2665.23s
4. Application of QM modeling: Solar thermal fuels (I)	And this distance here in energy between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied level, the HOMO/LUMOS, that's called the band gap. This is called the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, and this is the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5zt5u-C_uY#t=4470.06s
7. Quantum modeling of solids: Basic properties	So associated with each real space lattice, there exists something we call reciprocal lattice. It's a set of wave vectors which are commensurate with the real space lattice. Sometimes, we call it G. Why not? Those are the lattice vectors in reciprocal space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvwDJ3Op2Js#t=1584.92s
7. Quantum modeling of solids: Basic properties	But to see-- the thing that matters is this minimum amount of energy, the band gap of the material that is the lowest amount of energy that it would take to get an electron up from the valence into the conduction bands.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvwDJ3Op2Js#t=4790.98s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	Actually, it's nothing more than what those two words say. Quantum confinement is the squeezing of quantum things. And in this case, our quantum things are positive and negative charges. Right? And it turns out, when you make an expectation, the positive and negative charge like to be kind of close to each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=245.08s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	This is butadiene plus ethylene going to cyclohexane-- hexene. It's one of the simplest ways you can actually make a ring. Watch those electrons. Those are the electrons of the part of the system that's doing the reaction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=959.34s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	And the final one to look into, but I won't talk about more, is called the EPR paradox. And this stands for Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. And it's a very interesting paradox, again, that comes out of quantum mechanics, which is that you can entangle the states of two particles together-- let's say the spin-- so that its total is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=2704.41s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	We're still working on it. Make what? AUDIENCE: Make soccer balls. JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Soccer balls. You can make pretty high temperature superconductors-- what would have been considered very high temperature before high TC came on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=3144.77s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	We're going to be solving for this. This is the wave function. This is what tells us where those electrons are going to be and how they're going to behave. And so the simplest way to write down a wave is what's called the plane wave, which is just a cosine-- it's a cosine plus sine, where you have an amplitude, and then you have this vector k at the spatial position, and then this frequency times the time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=3358.632s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	You see? We get energy levels-- the quantized energy levels that look like this, and we get psis that look like this. And these are psi squareds, which I'll tell you about in a minute.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=3991.71s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	It is the probability of finding the electron anywhere in space. Psi squared is the probability of finding a quantum mechanical particle anywhere in space. It is the wave function, and it is also where the particle will be with a given probability.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=4035.09s
1. It's a quantum world: The theory of quantum mechanics	So these are those allowable energy levels for the atom, which we'll start with that next time. But-- wait, don't go, we're not done yet. So now, I've said that the system is quantized, which means it can only have certain energies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGB8VlcFVzU#t=4319.82s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	And the coupled cluster approach is more of a traditional quantum chemistry approach, where instead of modifying the Hamiltonian, we just modify the wave functions. And we play around with the wave functions until they become something that's more close to something that would exist in reality.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=1066.11s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	"When it's positive 1, we call them ""bosons."" So this leads to a lot of interesting physics, like the Bose-Einstein condensate, which I don't know if you guys have heard about. There's a lot of cool experiments that have been done on helium 4, where at a low enough temperature, all of the helium atoms suddenly find themselves in exactly the same ground state."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=1973.53s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	"And there's some really bizarre consequences of that. However, what we're interested in are the particles with an eigenvalue of minus 1. Those are called ""fermions."" Electrons are fermions. So electrons, therefore, need to have an eigenvalue of negative 1."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=1996.21s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	"MICHELE: Great. Great. So generally a function, you input a number and output a number. A functional, you input a function and output a number. So this is called ""density functional theory,"" because we are writing a functional of the function density."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=2631.62s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	Are you guys familiar with the variational principle in quantum mechanics? The lowest energy possible for a system is the ground state. And so any time that you can find any system that gives you a lower energy, you're getting closer to the ground state.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=2716.94s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	Again, this is pretty much the same Hamiltonian you've been looking at all class, all last week, too. We have the kinetic term. We have the potential term, and that acts on a wave function, and gives us some eigenvalue times the wave function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=2798.53s
3. From many-body to single-particle: Quantum modeling of molecules	And they're pretty self-explanatory. The local density approximation, you just approximate the local density as being a flat in a local area. And the general gradient approximation, you assume a first derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoxlFUerR0#t=2870.83s
2. Practice makes perfect	"And even more astounding, these particles can appear out of the nothingness of space, exist for an extremely brief instant, and then disappear. Scientists call them ""virtual particles."" They may be virtual, but they can have very real effects."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkfedF3Y7k#t=1149.86s
2. Practice makes perfect	The particles are jumping around, coming into and out of existence. And those places where the wave crests are maximum, are the places where the particle materializes most of the time, while the places where the crests are minimum are the places the particle avoids.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkfedF3Y7k#t=1202.81s
2. Practice makes perfect	The wave is a map of the particles' existence. And as the wave changes, the particle changes as well. [END PLAYBACK] JEFFREY GROSSMAN: There you go. I love these kinds of videos, and not just for the soundtracks, because those are pretty cool.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkfedF3Y7k#t=1224.09s
2. Practice makes perfect	Now what's happening? And here, we go back to this world of particles, this field theory world, basically, of how particles move, by essentially annihilating themselves and reappearing. That's how electrons really move.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkfedF3Y7k#t=2876.55s
2. Practice makes perfect	That Hamiltonian is some simpler Hamiltonian that you can solve easily plus some perturbation to it. We're not going to really do that. Has anybody used perturbation theory? So we're not going to do it much but, I'm just using it for reference.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkfedF3Y7k#t=3185.43s
2. Practice makes perfect	And each one of these is an m. m equals plus or minus 1 and 0. So that's why I have three p's. So those are those quantum numbers you get from quantizing the solution to the Schrodinger equation for an electron in the 1 over r potential.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkfedF3Y7k#t=3415.72s
10. Solar photovoltaics	Remember, I said 100 nanometers of thickness is all you need to absorb all the light in some of these materials, even less. OK? But where there is a challenge is how do you get them-- how do you pull them apart? And the way you do it is you create interfaces, where when this electron and hole pair get to the interface, one of them really sees the grass is really greener on the other side of that interface.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GIRyIkHJZI#t=3087.75s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	You see, a sponge that's going to-- a chemical sponge that's going to absorb hydrogen and give it back out when I want it, it's got to be just the right amount of binding.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=783.89s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	And here it's way too hard, way too high. So methane-- the carbon is holding on to those hydrogens. And you need to go to thousands of degrees to pull them off.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=811.28s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	So this is a really important concept that, essentially, gives this. It gives us the wiggles. This reciprocal space is the language we need to describe the wiggles. So just to review for most of you, with each real space lattice, like the square that I showed you, you can make a reciprocal lattice.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=1841.58s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	No, I'll tell you why right now. You see-- and then I'll come back to it, because it might not make total sense right now-- you see, the Brillouin zone is an area of-- it's a volume, in 3D, of space, of reciprocal space, not real space, reciprocal space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=2256.57s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	This is a quantum number, k, that lives in inverse space. So Bloch's Theorem says that, if I go from one point in space to another point that's translated by just a lattice factor, then I equal my original wave function time this phase.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=3018.25s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	And if those things can change-- of course, it's not really changing. The mass of the electron isn't really changing. But the effective mass, the mass that it feels in the crystal, is changing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=3546.29s
6. Hydrogen storage, and atoms to molecules	It's directly related to the mobility. So the transport properties are deeply dependent on this wiggling. So Bloch's Theorem is a formal theorem that tells you that you have to write wave functions in such a way that you have a dependence on the inverse lattice.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQi0jHQ3to#t=3591.09s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: The band gap. The gap, or the gap of the molecule-- and you see, because that's the other component here. So these are-- problem 3 is talking about theoretical limits based on how much the molecule stores and how much sunlight shines on it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=804.19s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	What are basis functions, and how do if you have Enough yeah AUDIENCE: So basis functions are a set of functions which you can take combinations of to create an approximation of what the exact function should be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=1236.44s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	And even then, it's too hard. So we've got to simplify this equation. And mostly in the quantum chemistry world, what you do is you simplify this. We talked about using basis sets, basis functions to represent this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=2362.91s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	You define it in a computer. And then we talked about the inverse lattice, and I'm not going to go through this again. But we built this up. Why did we build up the inverse lattice, the understanding of that? Where does that come in? Why do you need to know about inverse lattice? Yeah? AUDIENCE: Because that's how we define the Brillouin zone, which is where we define the k-space vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=3073.46s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	It's really important in crystallography, so I think a lot of you have seen this. And you can define by just drawing these perpendiculars to the nearest neighbors you defined the first Brillouin zone, which is where the energy levels, those precious energy levels of this molecule that I want-- that first Brillouin zone is where in the inverse lattice-- see, this now becomes inverse space, also known as k-space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=3115.13s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Pretty much. That's where the variation that could happen in the energy levels is going to happen. And that's what you want to capture, right? So a band structure is a simple two-dimensional way of cruising through this kind of complex three-dimensional Brillouin zone where things are varying any point I go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=3503.115s
9. Some review and introduction to solar photovoltaics	Did everybody get that? Fermi energy is the energy that you fill the electrons to. So if you have an odd number of electrons, well, how many electrons go in each one of these bands? AUDIENCE: Two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOQ0O90DjI#t=3689.9s
5. Second-Order Equations (continued)	I and minus i. So this is undamped. S1 is i and s2 is minus i. That's the pure oscillation. Pure oscillation, that's the case where b is 0 here, I have a square root of a negative number, and it gives me plus or minus 2i, and then the 2s cancel and I get plus or minus i.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx8dVLkrWs#t=946.5s
5. Second-Order Equations (continued)	What's the rest of it? C2 e to the s2 t. The impulse response is the particular null solution that starts with a shot, starts with an impulse, starts with a strike.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx8dVLkrWs#t=3209.95s
5. Second-Order Equations (continued)	Everybody sees that I have a minus p here. And with a little care you get p squared, which is quite nice. Which is quite nice. And so we see that the decision between overdamping-- remember now? Overdamping is when you damped so much that this became negative and you got an imaginary number in there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx8dVLkrWs#t=4016.02s
5. Second-Order Equations (continued)	And let me just say what that is. So omega d, the damped frequency, squared, is this omega natural frequency squared minus the p squared. If I had longer and we didn't have blackboards already full of formulas, I could-- it's the thing whose square root we're taking here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx8dVLkrWs#t=4436.72s
3. First-Order Equations (continued)	It'll get closer, and exponentially close. That wasn't a bad picture. The population here is half way. Here, the population, the final population, is a over b. And just by beautiful symmetry, the population here is a 1/2 of a over b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp94Hph_-BU#t=2108.44s
2. First-Order Equations	Let's see if we can solve it for a delta function, a delta function, an impulse that starts at time T. Again, I'm just going to start writing down the solution and ask for your help what to write next.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X0SGGrXDiI#t=3222.69s
4. Second-Order Equations	We can work with cosines and sines. The first question is, what's omega. What is the frequency of oscillation. And of course, another similar picture would be a pendulum, a linear pendulum, swinging side to side, keeping time, because that frequency will stay constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvTYUnqn2wY#t=248.36s
4. Second-Order Equations	So I cancel those, and I get ms squared plus k equals zero. The key equation-- and it's so simple-- it's just we're doing algebra now. The calculus, the derivative we took when we plugged it in, but now it's an algebra question.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvTYUnqn2wY#t=468.29s
4. Second-Order Equations	And if you haven't got those two well-separated, you're in trouble, as this shows. Or similarly, when an architect designs a skyscraper, there's going to be a frequency of oscillation, a natural frequency, at which that skyscraper swings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvTYUnqn2wY#t=2783.08s
Lec 8 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So how do we define this? A walk is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. So for example, we may have something that looks like a first vertex. That we call the start.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpt_3ie4WU#t=86.74s
Lec 8 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And an edge that goes to a second vertex. We continue like this until the end, say, at vk, which we call the end of the walk. And if you look at this, we say this is a walk from v0 all the way to vk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpt_3ie4WU#t=115.52s
Lec 8 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And within trees, we also have something very special that we call leaves. And leaves are exactly those nodes that have degree one. So for example, this node has degree one. It has only this edge connected to it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpt_3ie4WU#t=1071.23s
Lec 8 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Let's define spanning trees. So what's a spanning tree? A spanning tree is a subgraph of a graph that somehow spans all the vertices within this graph. So it's a tree that touches every single vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpt_3ie4WU#t=1833.33s
Lec 8 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now this property I will not prove right now, but it is pretty straightforward. It's a one line proof actually in the book. So you can look it up. So it simply states that if you have a tree, if you add another edge, an edge that is not contained in E star, then we will create a cycle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpt_3ie4WU#t=4559.93s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	We have a property that we call antisymmetric, which is the opposite of this. Antisymmetric means that if x likes y and y likes x, then x and y must be the same.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=554.04s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So this is what we are going to talk about next. So we'll first start with equivalence relations, so let's do this. What is an equivalence relation? An equivalence relation is exactly a relation that has those few properties over there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=1000.42s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And it's defined as follows. A partition of A is a collection of this joint non-empty sets A1 up to An and they're all subsets of A. And the union of all of those is actually equal to the set A. So who's union is A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=1265.27s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	But for now, let's just call partial orders those that are reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Well, we already saw a few examples up here. We have divisibility, which has this property and also the less than or equal relationship.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=1624.25s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And we also abbreviate this by calling it a poset. Now, in a poset, again, can be described by means of a directed graph, so we can do that as well. So poset is a directed graph such that it has the vertex set A and the edge set is defined by the relationship.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=1763.48s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let's define what this really is and then we'll continue with some nice properties of this structure. So what is a Hesse diagram? A Hesse diagram is really one in which I use the set A as the vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=2209.43s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let me redefine it again more formally. So what is it? A topological sort of a poset is formally defined as a total order. It's a total order that has the same set of items of elements A but has a different relation that we will denote by a subscript, t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=3199.62s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And in order to do that, we're going to define what is called a chain. And a chain is this sequence of elements that are related to one another. It's a sequence of distinct elements such that a1 is smaller than a2, smaller than a3, and so on up to some at.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nScXLQAQ9A#t=3535.91s
Lec 19 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	The product rule says that the probability of A and B for two events is equal to the probability of B times the probability of A given B. And that's just follow straightforwardly from this definition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6FbvM-FGZ8#t=331.6s
Lec 19 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	FCS is the event that the applicant is female and applying to CS. FEE is the event that the applicant is female and applying to EE. MCS is the event the applicant is a male and CS.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6FbvM-FGZ8#t=4285.93s
Lec 24 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And we saw how that gave us some feel for the likelihood of being far from the expectation-- high variance meaning you're more likely to deviate from the expectation. Today, we're going to develop specific tools for bounding or limiting the probability you deviate by a specified amount from the expectation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4mwO2qS2z4#t=82.38s
Lec 24 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And the first tool is known as Markov's theorem. Markov's theorem says that if the random variable is always non-negative, then it is unlikely to greatly exceed its expectation. In particular, if R is a non-negative random variable, then for all x bigger than 0, the probability that R is at least x is at most the expected value of R, the mean, divided by x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4mwO2qS2z4#t=103.13s
Lec 3 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	That's a great idea. Let's really specify that now, and define that. A pair of letters or items, call them L1 and L2-- they form an inversion, also known as an inverted pair, if L1 precedes L2 in the alphabet, but L1 appears after L2 in the puzzle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuGDkmwEObM#t=2072.86s
Lec 3 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	No, the first move is M1. The second is M2. Now, when I talk about zero moves, that means no moves are taking place. I'm still in the start state. So a move is a transition between states.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuGDkmwEObM#t=3388.34s
Lec 4 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	There are many application in cryptography. But we'll be talking about one of them to show you how useful this actually is. Now cryptography is the study and practice of hiding numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuY7szYSXSw#t=123.15s
Lec 4 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Oh, before I forget, you will denote this remainder as rem of b, a. And this is the notation that we use in this lecture. So what's the lemma? The lemma is that the greatest common divisor of a and b, is equal to the greatest common divisor of the remainder of b and a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuY7szYSXSw#t=3683.28s
Lec 4 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And that will show us the final result, which is that the theorem that the greatest common divisor of a and b is actually the smallest positive linear combination of a and b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuY7szYSXSw#t=4696.969s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	OK, now in mathematics, there's this higher level. And someone stated it very clearly up there. Let me write it up here. In mathematics, we have a mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=444.0s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	We'll start with propositions. A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. You may not know which one, but it's one or the other. A simple example-- 2 plus 3 equals 5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=521.144s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And that means for every possible choice of n-- and this is in the natural numbers, which is the set 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth. It's the natural numbers. It's basically the integers, but not negative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=600.11s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So we're saying for every natural number, i.e. for 0, for 1, for 2, and for 3, and so forth, this expression is a prime. Now, a prime number is a number that is not divisible by any other number besides itself and 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=619.57s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	This equation is an example of what's called an elliptic curve-- elliptic curve. You study these if you're really a specialist in mathematics in graduate school, or if you work for certain three-letter agencies because it's central to the understanding of how to factor large integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=1102.58s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now, the good news is that axioms are the same thing, really, as propositions. The only difference is that axioms are propositions that we just assume are true. An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=2147.54s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	"There's no proof that an axiom is true. You just assume it because you think it's reasonable. In fact, the word ""axiom"" comes from Greek. It doesn't mean to be true. It means to think worthy-- something you think is worthy enough to be assumed to be true."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=2180.13s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	A set of axioms is said to be complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false. Now, this is desirable because it means-- well, you can solve every problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ#t=2472.14s
Lec 15 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	PROFESSOR: All right. So last time we talked about methods for solving recurrences, and we spent most of our time talking about divide-and-conquer recurrences. These are recurrences where you break the problem up into much smaller sub-problems, like half the size or 2/3 the size.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBB-JlmYUc#t=22.745s
Lec 15 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	OK. So now we have all the information necessary to solve the problem. So let's do that and set up a recurrence. We're going to define f of n to be the number of professors during year n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBB-JlmYUc#t=364.68s
Lec 15 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	All right. So we've been looking at linear recurrences, which means you have something like f of n minus a1 f of n minus 1 minus ad f of n minus d equals 0, and that means it's homogeneous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBB-JlmYUc#t=3161.95s
Lec 15 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Homogeneous means you have the 0 here. You got all these f terms here, right, and there's nothing else. f of n minus a1 f n minus 1 dot dot dot minus ad f n minus d equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBB-JlmYUc#t=3224.326s
Lec 17 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So we still need to add intersection-- everything that is counted in the intersection of M, E, as well as S. So we have this equation. And now you can see why we call this the inclusion-exclusion principle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yIb3VHhMI#t=592.95s
Lec 17 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So all the digits. And that have consecutive-- so I put this in brackets just to clarify-- so consecutive either a 4 and a 2 right next to one another. So remember, a permutation is a sequence that has each of those digits exactly once.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yIb3VHhMI#t=875.42s
Lec 17 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	OK. A theorem that we can have derived from all this stuff is what we call the binomial theorem. So we'll quickly go over that. The binomial theorem says that, for all integers n-- positive integers n-- we have a plus b to the power n equals to the sum where we take k from 0 to n and then we have the binomial where we have this expression over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yIb3VHhMI#t=1942.37s
Lec 17 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	A full house is a special hand. It has three cards of one value and two cards of another value. So how many are there? So again, we are going to use the exact same principle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yIb3VHhMI#t=2867.52s
Lec 14 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now, the ceiling function means the smallest integer that's at least that big. So you're sort of rounding up to the next integer. And the floor function means you're rounding down to the next integer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqf0uO0oV6s#t=2380.12s
Lec 20 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Another nice fact about independent events is that it's a symmetric relationship. It's called the symmetry of independence. That says that if they A is independent of B, then the reverse is true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1BCv3qqW4A#t=719.96s
Lec 20 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So independence means that if you want the probability of a bunch of events occurring, just multiply them out individually. And that follows for independence or it could be the definition of independence, depending on how you want to do it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1BCv3qqW4A#t=1886.81s
Lec 20 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let me write that down then we'll be done. All right. So the birthday principle says that if S is at least 100, L prime is a subset of L that is at least the square root of S.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1BCv3qqW4A#t=4741.56s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So Euler tour is a walk that traverses every edge exactly once. And at the same time, it's also a tour. So that means that it actually starts and finishes at the same vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=162.21s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now if there is an edge that is not covered in this walk-- and I can lengthen the walk, right? So if I have, say, another edge, which looks like Vk, an edge from Vk to some U, where this edge is not in the walk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=810.3s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So we'll do that a bit later. So what are directed graphs? Directed graphs are graphs where we have edges that have a specific direction. So we can walk from one vertex to the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=1393.16s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So every edge has a direction. And we usually say that if we have an edge that points from V2 to, say, V3, then we call this the tail and over here we have the head.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=1459.69s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So that's why we define a stronger notion for a digraph. So a digraph, G, VE is called strongly connected if we know that for every pair-- so if for all vertices U and V in the vertex set-- there exists a directed path that starts in U and ends up in V in G.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=2441.27s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And that will lead to partial ordering. So that's something that we will talk about as well. So what's the definition? A directed graph is called a directed acyclic graph, and we appreciate this by DAG.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=2623.05s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let's first write out a definition of this. A directed Hamiltonian path is a directed walk that visits every vertex exactly once. So as I said already, here we have such an example.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=3018.07s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So a chicken that is able to virtually peck everyone else, we will call a king. So chicken that virtual pecks every other chicken is called a king chicken. So let's give an example of a graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOIp5D7VMS4#t=4319.26s
Lec 18 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	For example, when you're designing algorithms in 006 or 6046, you're going to be designing in some cases probabilistic algorithms-- algorithms that flip coins or generate random numbers to get the result.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmFwFdESMHI#t=85.66s
Lec 18 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	In fact, let me define an outcome, also known as an atomic event or a sample point. An outcome, also known as a sample point-- we'll use those terms interchangeably-- consists of all the information about the experiment, including-- and that's after it's been performed-- including the values of all random choices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmFwFdESMHI#t=1773.75s
Lec 18 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Let me define what an event is. An event is simply a subset of outcomes, a subset of the sample space. For example, we could define the event of losing. Let's call EL, E sub-L, to be the event that player loses, the player loses, with the switch strategy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmFwFdESMHI#t=3405.54s
Lec 12 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	An annuity is a financial instrument that pays a fixed amount of money every year for some number of years, and it has a value associated with it. For example, with a student loan, the value is the amount of money they gave you to pay MIT, then later in life-- every year or every month-- you're going to send them a check.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAeShezAGLE#t=37.42s
Lec 12 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Megabucks, the lottery. They don't actually give you the million dollars. They give you $50,000 per year for 20 years, and call it a million bucks. Retirement plans. You pay in every year, and then you get some big lump sum later.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAeShezAGLE#t=123.69s
Lec 12 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now, the integral from 1 to n of f of x is this stuff, the stuff under the curve. It comes down here, starts at 1, and it's the stuff under the curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAeShezAGLE#t=3001.57s
Lec 2 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Then you just take steps for logical deductions forward until you arrive at a contradiction, something where you prove false equals true. Now if you can ever get to the point we approve something is false and true, that means what you assumed at the start had to be wrong.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HKWUWS-lA#t=125.35s
Lec 2 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And the Pythagoreans were a religious society started by Pythagoras, of Pythagoras theorem frame. Now it sounds weird today, but back then, in ancient Greece, math was a religion, all right? Every once in while you'll see somebody around MIT, and you'll think he must think math is a religion, but back then it really was, and it was ruled by God, because this is ancient Greece.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HKWUWS-lA#t=592.27s
Lec 2 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And you state that. You say let p of n be the proposition, the predicate, that the sum i equals 1 to n of i equals n times n plus 1 over 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HKWUWS-lA#t=1736.46s
Lec 21 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So this is the random variable, and we'll often denote that by rv. This is the sample space of all possible outcomes. And this is just the reals. All right, so in other words, a random variable is just a way of assigning a real number to each possible outcome.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOfhhFaQdjw#t=120.512s
Lec 21 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	An indicator also known as a Bernoulli or characteristic random variable, is a random variable whose range or possible values is just 0 and 1. So it's a random variable where the real numbers are 0, 1 that you assign to every sample point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOfhhFaQdjw#t=248.86s
Lec 21 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	We've got R and M. We've talked about two random variables. Are they independent random variables? M is the indicated random variable for all the coins matching. R is the random variable that tells us how many heads there were in three coins.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOfhhFaQdjw#t=929.43s
Lec 21 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Say we have two fair independent six-sided die, normal dice. And the outcome of the first one is D1, and the outcome of the second roll is D2. And by independent, I mean here that knowing any information about what the second die is does not give you any change in your probability that the first die has any value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOfhhFaQdjw#t=1058.18s
Lec 21 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Very simple. But now we're characterizing it as a function. And there's also a notion of the cumulative distribution function, which is going to be the probability that R is less than or equal to x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOfhhFaQdjw#t=1811.32s
Lec 21 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	OK, and this is a whole field in computer science where you get randomized algorithms, where this strategy depends on a coin flip, on guessing a value. And it leads to getting potentially a better outcome.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOfhhFaQdjw#t=2735.97s
Lec 23 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	A3 is the event that terrorists shoot their way in and cause a meltdown. So you've got a lot of possibilities for how the thing can melt down. And then they compute the probabilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI9fMUqgfxY#t=904.34s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now, when we talk about sets, we may also be interested in ordered collection of elements. And that's what we call a sequence. So a sequence is defined as follows. A sequence is an ordered collection of elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNt5Ll6hGqo#t=210.52s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And we say that-- oh-- with the property that every single element, every element, of X is actually related to exactly one element of Y. And we will call x to be the domain of the function f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNt5Ll6hGqo#t=678.73s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Bijective is if every element of y is mapped to exactly once. And we can see that the function is bijective if and only if it is both surjective and injective. So bijective if and only if we have both the properties surjectvie as well as injective.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNt5Ll6hGqo#t=960.35s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Over here, we talks about surjectivity, injectivity, and bijectivity. And now we will talk about the following property. We say that a k to 1 function is f from x to y actually maps actually k elements of x to every element of y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNt5Ll6hGqo#t=2808.61s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So the sum rule states that if you look at sets, then we may be able to count their union. And we will consider a very specific case. In the next lecture, we will talk about the general case.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNt5Ll6hGqo#t=4331.68s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	They brought them in, on many occasions, to try to get the answer for the question once and for all. And they wrote this 700 page book, called The soul of Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the US.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=243.2s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So that's an example of a graph. Now this being a math class, we got to give a formal definition of a graph. And we'll usually use the formal definition. A graph G is a pair of sets often called V and E.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=550.323s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And E, the set of edges, is pairs, unordered pairs of vertices. So for example x1, x2 is an edge. And it's the same as the set x2, x1, doesn't matter the order here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=648.95s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And E is just the empty set. Now for a general graph, when you do have edges, we say that two nodes, call them xi and xj, are adjacent if they're connected by an edge, namely if xi xj is an edge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=762.73s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	The number of edges incident to a node is called the degree of the node. So for example, what's the degree of x5 over here? 3, so in this case, the degree of x5 equals 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=863.41s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	A graph is simple if it has no loops, or multiple edges. Now a loop is an edge that only connects up one node, that's a loop and we don't allow it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=926.57s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	A multiple edge is we've got two edges that are really the same, they connect the same endpoints. Also called a multi-edge. And those we're not going to have in simple graphs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=956.25s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And that'll give us the average degree. So the average degree is the sum of the degrees, over all men, x in the set of men, of the degree of x, divided by the number of men.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=1300.735s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let's define that. Given a graph G, and K colors, assign a color to each node, so that adjacent nodes get different colors. All right, and then the minimum number of colors you need is called the chromatic number of the graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=1846.496s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	I was a undergraduate at Princeton. And Princeton, to this day I think, still has exams after the holidays, the Christmas holidays, New Year's holidays. And the students wanted to have the exams before Christmas, because they hated going home for the holiday, and then you've got to worry about your exams when you come back.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=2864.82s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So you've constructed a particular graph. This is actually called, for the n nodes, it's called Kn, is the n node complete graph, also called a clique, like a clique of friends, where everybody likes everybody, in a clique.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=3873.904s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And that's important to remember. All right, so a graph G is said to be bipartite if the vertices can be split into two sets, or partitioned, and we'll call them a left set, and a right set, so that all the edges connect a node in the left set, to a node in the right set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9wxtqoa1jY#t=4569.47s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let me write this down. So the latency is the time that is required for a packet to travel from an input to an output. And how are we going to measure this? Well, we're just going to measure this by the number of wires that we need to go through.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyxpoi2dmM#t=390.837s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So permutation is a function pi from the set 0 to n minus 1 to the same set. And it is such that no two numbers are mapped to more than once.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyxpoi2dmM#t=1068.47s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	This one would be 011 and its column is indexed by integer 2. So a switch is uniquely identified by its row and column. We will have b1 up to b logarithm of n, which are the number of bits to represent the row in digits, and to finally have an integer l and this we will call the level.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyxpoi2dmM#t=2678.04s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So the intuition that we are going to create is we're going to list our constraints, the constraints that we need to satisfy, like the zero and the fourth input should not both be mapped to this top subnetwork and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyxpoi2dmM#t=3649.08s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And for each of these inputs, we can make such a choice. But we have to be very smart about it because we need to avoid any congestion. So the intuition is that we're going to set up a constraint graph, a graph that represents all the constraints that we need to satisfy in order to achieve congestion of one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyxpoi2dmM#t=3984.1s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So in order to avoid congestion in this particular switch over here, we need to have a constraint. The constraint says that the packet for packets two and six, that those two cannot go through the same subnetwork.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyxpoi2dmM#t=4437.89s
Lec 25 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	W star is the event that the random walk hits T, which is n plus m, before it hits 0. In other words, you go home happy without going broke. Let's also define D to be the number of dollars at the start.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56iFMY8QW2k#t=780.58s
Lec 25 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So the goal is to figure this out. Now to do this, we could use the tree method. But it gets pretty complicated, because the sample space is the sample space of all one-loss sequences.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56iFMY8QW2k#t=851.25s
Lec 25 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	You could win it, or you could lose it. And then we're going to recurse. So we're going to define E to be the event that you win the first bet. And E bar is the event that you lose the first bet.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56iFMY8QW2k#t=1060.38s
Lec 25 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now I can use the definition of conditional probability to rewrite these. This is the probability-- you've got two events-- that the first one happens given D equals n times the probability the second one happens given that the first one happened and D equals n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56iFMY8QW2k#t=1165.63s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let's define a matching, given a graph, G, with nodes, V, and edges, E. In matching, you can think of it as a collection of edges, or a subgraph of G where every node has degree 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=84.47s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And then the goal is to find a matching with minimum weight. Now, the weight of a matching, call it M, is the sum of the weights on the edges of M. Now, usually when you're looking at weighted matchings, you require yourself to have a perfect matching so that everybody gets paired up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=444.51s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So for when you look at minimum weight matchings, you're looking for the perfect matching with minimum weight. So we say a min-weight matching for a graph, G, is a perfect matching for G with the minimum weight, overall perfect matchings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=502.58s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now, in the version of the problem that we're going to look at, everybody has preferences-- a preference list. It's not weighted, but it's a priority order of who they want to get mated to, or matched up with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=664.97s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	You can find examples where there's always a rogue couple, but if you require boys to only get matched to girls and vice versa, then it is possible to always find stable marriages, stable matchings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=1056.6s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	PROFESSOR: Yeah, because TMA produces a stable matching, so we know that S is not empty. There's at least one. And, in fact, there could be many. Now, for each person, P, we define the realm of possibility for P to be the set of mates that you might have in a stable matching.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=4304.907s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So how many pre-meds are here? There's one, at least. So you're going to go to medical school some day, and at the end of medical school, there's a big day called match day, where you get assigned to a hospital for your internship, and the way that works is using this algorithm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RSMLgy06Ew#t=4888.48s
Lec 13 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	But they know it to a lot of decimal places. So basically H n is the log of n plus some fixed value between 0 and 1-- as we knew it had to be-- plus even some tail terms here that get very small as n gets large.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9eErxRjQEI#t=1957.76s
Lec 13 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Just comes up all the time. n factorial is the product of i equals 1 to n of i. It's the product of the first n natural numbers after zero. Now we'd like to be able to get a closed-form expression for this, because factorial is really not closed form, because it's hiding this thing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9eErxRjQEI#t=2145.53s
Lec 13 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So let me tell you what those are. It's called Stirling's formula. And that says that n factorial equals n over e to the n'th power times the square root of 2 pi n times e to the epsilon n where epsilon n is between 1 over 12n plus 1 and 1 over 12n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9eErxRjQEI#t=2470.97s
Lec 5 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	Now, encryption-- yeah, what is it? So let's first talk about it a little bit. Maybe some of you have heard about it. Cryptology in general is the art of hiding information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX7ePR21Ook#t=58.41s
Lec 5 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So I do not like this. And in order to avoid it, I will use encryption, which is some kind of algorithm that actually transforms my message m-- my plain message-- by using some kind of algorithm, E. Some encryption algorithm-- it can be a function as well-- that uses the keys in order to transform this into an encryption, which we call m prime here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX7ePR21Ook#t=121.06s
Lec 5 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So encryption to a very special kind of thing. We're not going to talk about the precise definitions here, but we just take the ID into this lecture. Now, decryption is transforming the cypher text back into the plain text.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX7ePR21Ook#t=175.24s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	In other words, you've got a 50% chance of being bigger than the median and a 50% chance of being smaller. Now precisely you can define it this way. The median of a random variable R is the value in the range of R such that the probability that the random variable is less than this median point is at most 1/2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGlMSe7uEkA#t=243.39s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	So each man gets a random hat back after dinner. And the question is, what is the expected number of men to get the right hat back? So we let R be the random variable that says the number of men to get the right hat, their happen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGlMSe7uEkA#t=4519.37s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010	And it's 0 if he doesn't. So whenever the ith guy gets his hat back, that counts as one, and now you can see why this sum works. R is the number of men to get the right hat back.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGlMSe7uEkA#t=4742.17s
22. Diagonalization and Powers of A	And then when I peeled off the lambdas, they were on the right-hand side, so I've got S, my matrix, back again. And this matrix, this diagonal matrix, the eigenvalue matrix, and I call it capital lambda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13r9QY6cmjc#t=323.69s
22. Diagonalization and Powers of A	It's a double root. So my algebraic multiplicity is two. But the geometric multiplicity, which looks for vectors, looks for eigenvectors, and -- which means the null space of this thing, and the only eigenvector is one zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13r9QY6cmjc#t=1468.34s
11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs	Nevertheless, you could add them and you could multiply by numbers, so we can call them vectors. I think the example I was working with they were matrices. So the -- so we had like a matrix space, the space of all three by three matrices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdtqGM6KWU#t=33.18s
11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs	And I had some subspaces that were interesting, like the symmetric, the subspace of symmetric matrices, symmetric three by threes. Or the subspace of upper triangular three by threes. Now I, I use the word subspace because it follows the rule.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdtqGM6KWU#t=112.22s
11. Matrix Spaces; Rank 1; Small World Graphs	OK. Would the rank four matrices form a subspace? Let me take all five by seventeen matrices and think about rank four -- the subset of rank four matrices. Let me -- I'll write this down.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdtqGM6KWU#t=1533.17s
13. Quiz 1 Review	Now I take these rows away from these, so that gives me zero. There. there?1 And now what more would I do if I'm really shooting for R, the reduced row echelon form? I would -- then I want plus ones in the pivot, so I would multiply through by minus one to get plus there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l88D4r74gtM#t=433.54s
13. Quiz 1 Review	Well, the singular ones wouldn't work either. They have zero -- the zero matrix is in the singular matrices, but if I add two singular matrices I don't know if the answer is singular or not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l88D4r74gtM#t=1221.01s
27. Positive Definite Matrices and Minima	They're the pivots, and that's why positive pivots give me sum of squares. Positive pivots, those pivots are the numbers that go outside the squares, so positive pivots, sum of squares, everything positive, graph goes up, a minimum at the origin, it's all connected together; all connected together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7eyJ2g3kU#t=2079.889s
20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume	So things with three factors go in here. Things with how many factors do things in the cofactor matrix have? What's a typical cofactor? What's the cofactor of a? The cofactor of a, the one one entry up here in the inverse is? I throw away the row and column containing a and I take the determinant of what's left, that's the cofactor.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNpj-gOXW9M#t=350.9s
20. Cramer's Rule, Inverse Matrix, and Volume	He realized what matrix it was, what these B1 and B2 and B3 and so on matrices were. Let me write them on the board underneath. OK. So what is this B1? This B1 is the matrix that has b in its first column and otherwise the rest of it is A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNpj-gOXW9M#t=1320.97s
15. Projections onto Subspaces	And in other words the projection is some matrix that acts on this guy b and produces the projection. The projection P is the projection matrix acting on whatever the input is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_Ac6KiQ1t0#t=485.09s
2. Elimination with Matrices.	And we have a combination, a linear combination of the rows. Okay, I want to use that. Okay, so my question is what's the matrix that does this first step, that takes -- subtracts 3 of equation one from equation two? That's what I want to do.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA#t=1460.52s
2. Elimination with Matrices.	Okay. So, I've now given you the pieces, the elimination matrices, the elementary matrices that take each step. So now what? Now the next point in the lecture is to put those steps together into a matrix that does it all and see how it all happens.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA#t=1927.2s
2. Elimination with Matrices.	So what was that step? The step was subtract 3 times row one from row two. So what matrix will get me back? What matrix will bring back -- you know, if I started with a 2 12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6 2 because of this guy, I want to get back to the 2 12 I want to find the matrix which -- which undoes elimination, the matrix which multiplies this to give the identity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA#t=2695.87s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	OK, this is linear algebra lecture nine. And this is a key lecture, this is where we get these ideas of linear independence, when a bunch of vectors are independent -- or dependent, that's the opposite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=9.84s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	So spanning a space means -- so let me move that important stuff right up. OK. So vectors -- let me call them, say, V1 up to -- call you some different letter, say Vl -- span a space, a subspace, or just a vector space I could say, span a space means, means the space consists of all combinations of those vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=1121.25s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	So, we're looking at the question of -- again, OK. the case with independent columns is the case where the column vectors span the column space. They're independent, so they're a basis for the column space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=1932.26s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	OK. OK. Let's do some examples. Because now we've got definitions. Let me repeat the four things, the four words that have now got defined. Independence, that looks at combinations not being zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=2223.39s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	The rank of A, the number of pivot columns, is the dimension of the column space. Of course, you say. It had to be. Right. But just watch, look for one moment at the, the language, the way the English words get involved here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=2512.82s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	I take the rank of a matrix, the rank of a matrix. It's a number of columns and it's the dimension of -- not the dimension of the matrix, that's what I want to say.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=2541.81s
9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension	Yes. The null space is two dimensional. The null space, the dimension of the null space, is the number of free variables. So the dimension of the null space is the number of free variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBerM5jWsc#t=2935.18s
6. Column Space and Nullspace	So the correct answer is -- is not. Okay. Now let me ask you about -- the other thing we do is take the intersection. So what does intersection mean? Intersection means all vectors that are in both P and L.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o5Cmfpeo6g#t=436.77s
23. Differential Equations and exp(At)	So this is the stability region for powers -- this is the region -- absolute value of lambda, less than one. That's the stability for -- that tells us that the powers of A go to zero, this tells us that the exponential of A goes to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZqwi0wJovM#t=2831.96s
32. Quiz 3 Review	So same lambdas. And then, finally, I've got to review the point about the SVD, the Singular Value Decomposition. OK. So that's what this quiz has got to cover, and now I'll just take problems from earlier exams, starting with a differential equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgC1l_6ySkc#t=256.089s
32. Quiz 3 Review	Good. So I just take the square root, if I want the eigenvalues of A transpose -- If I want the sigmas and I know these, I take the square root, the positive square root.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgC1l_6ySkc#t=1803.47s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	And then, now, let's see, I was going to write down Fourier, so you remember Fourier as this vector of all ones, and then, the vector -- oh, well, actually, I gave a lecture earlier about the Fourier matrix, this matrix whose columns are powers of a complex number w.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGkn-3NFGck#t=742.09s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So a sequence of images that's highly correlated and the problem in compression is always to use this correlation, this fact that, in time, or in space, things don't change instantly, they're very often smooth changes, and, you can predict one value from the previous value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGkn-3NFGck#t=1260.97s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So the competition for Fourier is called wavelets, and I can describe what that basis is like, say, in the eight by eight case. So the eight by eight wavelet basis is the vector of all ones, eight ones, then the vector of four ones and four minus ones, then the vector of two ones, and two minus ones, and four zeroes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGkn-3NFGck#t=1310.15s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So those are eight vectors in eight-dimensional space, those are called wavelets, and it's a very simple wavelet choice, it's a more sophisticated choice. This is a little jumpy, to jump between one and minus one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGkn-3NFGck#t=1367.4s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So, I mean, you're actually getting a kind of up-to-date, picture of where this big world of signal and image processing is. That Fourier is what everybody knew, and what people automatically used, and the new one is wavelets, where this is the simplest set of wavelets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGkn-3NFGck#t=2069.52s
30. Linear Transformations and Their Matrices	So T -- it's like a function. Exactly like a function. You give me an input, the transformation produces the output. So transformation, sometimes the word map, or mapping is used. A map between inputs and outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts3o2I8_Mxc#t=171.8s
8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R	And then you set the free variables to zero, solve for the pivot variables, and you've got a particular solution, the particular solution that has zero free variables. OK. Now -- but that's only one solution, and now I'm looking for all.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q1q7s1jTzU#t=927.92s
8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R	And then I'll add. So the final result will be that the complete solution -- this is now the complete guy -- the complete solution is this one particular solution plus any, any vector, all different vectors out of the null space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q1q7s1jTzU#t=969.71s
8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R	OK. Do you -- this board really summarizes the lecture, and this sentence summarizes the lecture. The rank tells you everything about the number of solutions. That number, the rank r, tells you all the information except the exact entries in the solutions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q1q7s1jTzU#t=2797.1s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	And what are they? They're potential differences. That's what A computes. If I have potentials at the nodes and I multiply by A, it gives me the potential differences, the differences in potential, across the edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=844.73s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	Nothing will move if all potentials are the same. If all potentials are c, c, c, and c, then nothing will move. So we're, we have this one parameter, this arbitrary constant that raises or drops all the potentials.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=1013.95s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	Any three potentials are independent, good variables. The fourth potential is not, we need to set, and typically we ground that node. OK. Rank is three. Rank equals three. OK. Let's see, do I want to ask you about the column space? The column space is all combinations of those columns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=1162.92s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	Those are currents on the edges. And this relation between current and potential difference is Ohm's Law. This here is Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law says that the current on an edge is some number times the potential drop.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=1467.99s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	Physicists, be overjoyed, right, by this stuff. It, it says that in equals out. And in this case, the three arrows are all going out, so it says y1, y3, and y4 add to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=1727.86s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	It only has three edges. And the, those edges correspond to the independent guys. And in the graph there -- those three edges have no loop, right? The independent ones are the ones that don't have a loop.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=2280.24s
12. Graphs, Networks, Incidence Matrices	So it's this graph with no loops, and it's the one where the rows of A are independent. And what's a graph called that has no loops? It's called a tree. So a tree is the name for a graph with no loops.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-wh6yvk6uc#t=2333.36s
10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces	And I wrote down the standard basis. That's the standard basis. The basis -- the obvious basis for the whole three dimensional space. And then I wanted to make the point that there was nothing special, nothing about that basis that another basis couldn't have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlE7EgJFds#t=58.62s
10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces	I'm interested in what was the whole matrix that took me from A to R. How would you find that? Do you remember Gauss-Jordan, where you tack on the identity matrix? Let's do that again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlE7EgJFds#t=2023.16s
10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces	And what was the R that came out? It was I. So in chapter two, in chapter two, R was I. The row the, the reduced row echelon form of a nice invertible square matrix is the identity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlE7EgJFds#t=2230.48s
10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces	And those combinations, there's a zero matrix, the matrix that has all zeros in it. If I add that to another matrix, it doesn't change it. All the good stuff. If I multiply a matrix by one it doesn't change it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlE7EgJFds#t=2655.99s
10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces	So subspaces. Subspaces of M. All, all upper triangular matrices. Another subspace. All symmetric matrices. The intersection of two subspaces is supposed to be a subspace. We gave a little effort to the proof of that fact.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHlE7EgJFds#t=2741.26s
14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces	Let's say in three dimensions. So the blackboard extended to infinity, right, is a -- is a subspace, a plane, a two-dimensional subspace. It's a little bumpy but anyway, it's a -- think of it as a subspace, let me take the floor as another subspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzZUIYRCE38#t=874.41s
Lec 25 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So that's -- in mathematics, that's called the spectral Spectrum is the set of eigenvalues of a matrix. theorem. Spec- it somehow comes from the idea of the spectrum of light as a combination of pure things -- where our matrix is broken down into pure eigenvalues and eigenvectors -- in mechanics it's often called the principle axis theorem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umt6BB1nJ4w#t=484.26s
18. Properties of Determinants	If I have two equal rows, I know that the rank is less changes sign. than n. OK, ready for property five. Now, property five you'll recognize as P. It says that the elimination step that I'm always doing, or U and U transposed, when they're triangular,4 subtract a multiple, subtract some multiple l times row one from another row, row k, let's say.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srxexLishgY#t=866.55s
18. Properties of Determinants	I can factor a minus l out from this row, no problem. That was 3A. So now I've used property three and now I'm ready for the kill. Property four says that this determinant is zero, has two equal rows.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srxexLishgY#t=1093.11s
Lec 24b  | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So -- so this -- the projection matrix is the matrix that I multiply b by to get here. And I guess this first part, this is just part one a, I'm really asking you the -- the quick way to answer, to find P, is just to remember what the formula is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFxA8eIS6tA#t=308.49s
5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n	There's a little more to do with those guys, permutations and transposes. But then the heart of the lecture will be the beginning of what you could say is the beginning of linear algebra, the beginning of real linear algebra which is seeing a bigger picture with vector spaces -- not just vectors, but spaces of vectors and sub-spaces of those spaces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JibVXBElKL0#t=36.65s
5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n	And we may need them. We may have a perfectly good matrix, a perfect matrix A that's invertible that we can solve A x=b, but to do it -- I've got to allow myself that extra freedom that if a zero shows up in the pivot position I move it away.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JibVXBElKL0#t=102.16s
5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n	So actually if we ask Matlab to solve a system, it will do some elimination some row exchanges, which we don't think are necessary. Algebra doesn't say they're necessary, but accuracy -- numerical accuracy says they are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JibVXBElKL0#t=253.55s
5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n	We multiply them by numbers, usually called scalers. If we have a vector, we know what three V is. If we have a vector V and W, we know what V plus W is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JibVXBElKL0#t=1269.88s
5. Transposes, Permutations, Spaces R^n	And then a plane, a plane through the origin. Or a line, a line through the origin. So with R^3, the subspaces were R^3, plane through the origin, line through the origin and a zero vector by itself, zero zero zero, just that single vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JibVXBElKL0#t=2358.25s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	And this is the first lecture, lecture one. So, and later we'll give the web address for viewing these, videotapes. Okay, so what's in the first lecture? This is my plan. The fundamental problem of linear algebra, which is to solve a system of linear equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c#t=44.06s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	Of course, I won't always be able to see it from the column picture, either. It's the next lecture, actually, which is about elimination, which is the systematic way that everybody -- every bit of software, too -- production, large-scale software would solve the equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c#t=1528.71s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	Those nine columns and all their combinations may very well fill out the whole nine-dimensional space. But if the ninth column happened to be the same as the eighth column and gave nothing new, then probably what it would fill out would be -- I hesitate even to say this -- it would be a sort of a plane -- an eight dimensional plane inside nine-dimensional space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c#t=2076.139s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	Singular will -- if A minus I is singular, that tells me that one is an eigenvalue, right? The eigenvalues are the numbers that I subtract off -- the shifts -- the numbers that I subtract from the diagonal -- to make it singular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MF3pz-oYHo#t=633.19s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So u1 is Av1. Okay. Now, another vector gets taken over here somewhere. What I looking for? In this SVD, this singular value decomposition, what I'm looking for is an orthogonal basis here that gets knocked over into an orthogonal basis over there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx0lRBaXoz4#t=215.47s
33. Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse	So there will be some null space, the null space of A -- what will be the dimension of A's null space? How many free variables have we got? How many special solutions in that null space have we got? So how many free variables in this setup? We've got n columns, so n variables, and this tells us how many are pivot variables, that tells us how many pivots there are, so there are n-m free variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go2aLo7ZOlU#t=823.47s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	OK, here's the last lecture in the chapter on orthogonality. So we met orthogonal vectors, two vectors, we met orthogonal subspaces, like the row space and null space. Now today we meet an orthogonal basis, and an orthogonal matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNsCkP9mgRk#t=22.77s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	So Adhemar matrix is an orthogonal matrix that's got ones and minus ones, and a lot of ones -- some we know, some other sizes, there couldn't be a five by five I think.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNsCkP9mgRk#t=814.8s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005	I'm just looking for the idea. So what's the idea? Where did we have orthogonal -- a vector showing up that was orthogonal to this guy? Well, that was the first basic calculation of the whole chapter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNsCkP9mgRk#t=1804.07s
2. Group Theory	Perhaps a good the fraction of the planet now has used a spreadsheet at some point or the other. Big tables, which are these large triple store databases that we have discussed in prior lectures, are really what is used to store most of the analyzed data on Earth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=255.62s
2. Group Theory	And you can apply the reasoning from any of these four ways of thinking sort of interchangeably now. So we can think about data as associative arrays, as arrays that are indexed by words.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=532.08s
2. Group Theory	So mathematically, we treat an associative array as sets of keys and values that are drawn from infinite strict totally ordered set, we'll call it S. You might be like, what is that? What is an infinite strict totally ordered set? It's just a set where there's an ordering, where basically any two elements in the set, there's a function that will tell you one is greater than the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=1056.36s
2. Group Theory	So v less than or equal to plus infinity is always true. And plus infinity is, we're saying, the maximal element is a part of this set. Greater than or equal to negative infinity is always true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=2231.78s
2. Group Theory	It's a very powerful feature. And what we find is that in graph algorithms, where we're dealing with things on strings or other types of operations, that most graph algorithms can be reduced to operations, what are called on semi-rings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=2626.99s
2. Group Theory	The biggest one being the universal conformance of addition and multiplication of all associative arrays. So any two associative arrays, regardless of their size, can be multiplied and added to each other unlike traditional linear algebra, where you have very strict constraints about the dimensions of matrices in order for them to be added.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=2783.63s
2. Group Theory	We can't have a string and a negative string. So we don't get, like, a and minus a, which is part of a field. So we have is feld, which is a field without an inverse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=2887.69s
2. Group Theory	And so those form what are called semigroups. 14 of them are commutative, which means they are Abelian semigroups. Commutativity, that just means that you can switch the order of operations. a plus b is the same as b plus a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=2962.14s
2. Group Theory	Because it tends to be more efficient. That's basically you take each row and each column, you do an inner product, and then do the result. OK. Mathematically, from a theory perspective, you get yourself in less trouble if you think in terms of the outer product formulation, which is basically you take each row and vector, you do the outer product to form a matrix, and then you take all of these, and then combine them all together with the operation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUk8o-ZbF4c#t=4017.43s
1. Using Associative Arrays	And what we tend generally do is pull it into what we call this exploded schema where we still use the records. Those are the row keys. We create column keys, which are essentially the column label and the column value appended together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=428.42s
1. Using Associative Arrays	If a word appeared in a title, you would create a new column for that word with respect to that reference. An Ngram would be word pairs. A trigram would be all words that occur together in threes and on and on and on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=694.29s
1. Using Associative Arrays	So this allows you to, essentially, come back and reconstruct the original documents. So that's a perfectly good example of something that we don't tend to need to search on, which is the exact position of a word in a document.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=741.822s
1. Using Associative Arrays	Formally, this exploded schema is what you would call an incidence matrix. So in graph theory, graphs generally can be represented as two different types of matrix-- an adjacency matrix, which is a matrix where each row and column is a vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=1410.13s
1. Using Associative Arrays	It handles directed graphs very well. It does not handle graphs with multiple edges very well. It does not handle graphs with hyper-edges. These are edges that connect multiple vertices at the same time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=1447.19s
1. Using Associative Arrays	This is something that we see all the time, I should say, in what we call sub-sampled data where essentially the space of citations has not been fully sampled. If people stopped publishing and we created new documents and all citations only were of older things, then over time you would probably see this thing begin to take on a bit more of a bell-shaped curve, OK? But as long as you're an expanding world, then you will get this type of power law.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=1754.23s
1. Using Associative Arrays	And here, it's constructed very simply from this matrix-matrix multiply. I'm going to call this the inner square. So we actually have a short cut for this in D4M called [INAUDIBLE]. So [INAUDIBLE] means the matrix transposed times itself, which sort of has an inner product feel to it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=1937.42s
1. Using Associative Arrays	I think I've already talked about this. Just to remind people, here's a graph, a directed graph. We've numbered all the vertices. This is the adjacency matrix of that graph. So basically two vertices have an edge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=2166.49s
1. Using Associative Arrays	So we have five colors and 20 distinct vertices. We have 12 things that we really should consider to be multi-edges, OK? These are essentially multiple edges that connect the same vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=2348.6s
1. Using Associative Arrays	And I've labeled them by their color here. We have 19 hyper-edges. These are edges that fundamentally connect more than one vertex. So if we look at this example here, P3 connects this vertex, this vertex, this vertex, and this vertex with one edge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXJVqsbh_4Y#t=2363.3s
5. Perfect Power Law Graphs -- Generation, Sampling, Construction, and Fitting	So that's what we have in many of the traditional fields that we've worked in in signal processing, but now we're in this new area where a lot of our data sets arrive from artificial processes, processes that are a result of human actions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbr667kATEg#t=298.3s
5. Perfect Power Law Graphs -- Generation, Sampling, Construction, and Fitting	Basically of zero where there's no connection between-- this is a set of vertices connected with another set of vertices. There are N out of these vertices and N in of these vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbr667kATEg#t=428.58s
5. Perfect Power Law Graphs -- Generation, Sampling, Construction, and Fitting	You're going to have one which is called the integer regime, where basically each integer has one-- is representative. And then it transitions to a logarithmic regime. You might say this is somewhat artificial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbr667kATEg#t=653.634s
5. Perfect Power Law Graphs -- Generation, Sampling, Construction, and Fitting	I bring this up because in standard graph theory, as I've talked about in previous lectures, we often have what we call random, undirected Erdos-Renyi graphs, which are basically vertices without direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbr667kATEg#t=1240.45s
5. Perfect Power Law Graphs -- Generation, Sampling, Construction, and Fitting	In fact, there's many papers written on what is called densification. This is the observation that if you construct a graph, and you compute the ratio of the edges to vertices over time, that ratio will go up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbr667kATEg#t=1801.83s
3. Examples Demonstration	So basically Cat String takes one string list and another string list, and then it leaves them with a separator, a single character separator. And now I can construct a new sparse matrix, which has docks for the row key.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDjHvH8d2k#t=401.55s
3. Examples Demonstration	Then the result is an adjacency matrix, or graph between those two things. So then adjacency matrices are a projection from the incidence matrix. We've lost some information, we've always thrown away some information in doing that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDjHvH8d2k#t=1397.4s
1. Examples Demonstration	So I can say, get me the column color. And because orange is held in the value, I can actually compare it with the string. So I say, return me the matrix, the associative array of the row, color and everything equal to orange.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RqTJWf1l_A#t=974.74s
1. Examples Demonstration	We don't want to lose that. So we have invented special new matrix multiplies in the land of associative arrays. One of them we call a CatKeyMul, which you view the matrix multiply as sort of there's a key, a common key, this row column key that's being joined together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RqTJWf1l_A#t=1337.75s
6. Bio Sequence Cross Correlation	And so the data generated, you know, typically a human genome will have billions of DNA sequences in it. And that's a lot of data. What's actually perhaps even more interesting than sequencing your DNA is sequencing the DNA of all the other things that are in you, which is sometimes called the metagenome.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMUpevQzNzY#t=179.08s
6. Bio Sequence Cross Correlation	And this is all data that you want to cross correlate. I mean, it's your-- it's a-- so that's what this-- this is a table top, a table top apparatus here that sells for a few hundred thousand dollars.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMUpevQzNzY#t=247.85s
6. Bio Sequence Cross Correlation	And then a column is a particular 10mer. So as we can see, certain 10mers appear very commonly. And some appear in a not so common way. So that gives us an associative array, which is a sparse matrix where we have sequence ID by 10mer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMUpevQzNzY#t=728.68s
6. Bio Sequence Cross Correlation	So it basically creates the 10mers and puts them into a series of triple files, or a row triple file, which holds the sequence ID, the actual 10mer itself, a list of those, and then the position of where that 10mer appeared in the sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMUpevQzNzY#t=1689.04s
Lecture: Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning	Although I can write down an equation for circle, which is the equation for a perfect, ideal circle, we know that such things don't actually exist in nature. There is no true perfect circle in nature.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKPkJME2Jw#t=145.579s
Lecture: Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning	So really looking at the fundamentals, what are the ideals that we need in order to effectively reason about the problems that we're facing today in the virtual world, right, and the fact that this mathematical concept described the natural world so well and also described in the virtual world is sometimes called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKPkJME2Jw#t=332.999s
Lecture: Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning	We basically have to two times three plus four is equal to two times three plus two times four. That is called the distributive property. It basically says multiplication distributes over addition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKPkJME2Jw#t=589.92s
Lecture: Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning	It allows us to reason about queries, which are just a series of intersections and unions, and then reorder them in such a way. In databases, this is called query planning. And if that property wasn't true, we wouldn't be able to do that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKPkJME2Jw#t=811.79s
Lecture: Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning	And then we have a series of layers. These are called hidden layers. The circles are often referred to as neurons, OK? And each line connecting each dot has a value associated with it, a weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKPkJME2Jw#t=1690.419s
Lecture: Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning	And they got the system to think that that was an ostrich, right? And you can basically show this for anything, right? So what's called robust AI, or robust machine learning, machine learning that can't be tricked, is going to become more and more important.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKPkJME2Jw#t=2165.76s
5. Examples Demonstration	Whereas before, we broke up the edges, but we didn't change the labels. And so then the final one, which is the one that we typically do when we want to create random, is we permute both the vertices and the edges to create a truly random looking adjacency matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6-LQbqUCI0#t=391.79s
5. Examples Demonstration	So if we look at the first one here, this just shows the unweighted, what basically making the data unweighted does to the data set. So the triangles are the original data, and just making it unweighted, how it distorts that data set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6-LQbqUCI0#t=618.95s
5. Examples Demonstration	This shows you what happens when you make it undirected. So unweighted means we took any cases where we had vertices with more than one connection to them, if something had five connections, now it just gets one connection.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6-LQbqUCI0#t=642.69s
5. Examples Demonstration	And it has a continuous part and a discrete part. So what we do here is we do essentially a sampled search where we randomly sample, looking for a location. We do a heuristic search, which is a simulated [INAUDIBLE] search.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6-LQbqUCI0#t=1182.54s
5. Examples Demonstration	And we also use Broyden's nonlinear-- essentially a variation of Newton's method to all try and find the best set of parameters that will fit this data. We rarely get an exact match.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6-LQbqUCI0#t=1196.02s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	So the first thing that we wanted to do was look for a data set that was kind of open and out there. And we're fortunate that there is a group in Japan called the MAWI working group, which stands for the measurement-- and I'll use my cool tool-- the measurement and analysis of wide area internet traffic working group, that actually has 10 gig link that they've tapped using a network tap.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=99.565s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	As much as we'd all love to sit and write DDoS attacks and port scan attacks on ourselves, sometimes, you know, getting that at scale can be very difficult. So for the purpose of this work, we used a synthetic data generator, in which we took real internet traffic data but then injected synthetic attacks into it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=638.652s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	And so a lot of work has been done using network flows. And a network flow is, essentially, a sequence of packets from a single source to destination. So as you can imagine, when you're streaming a YouTube video, for example, it's not one big packet that comes to you, but it's a series of packets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=946.52s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	And so flow essentially tries to detect that and say, OK, all of these things was a person watching this video. Right? So from this source to this destination within some time window is defined as a network flow.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=963.65s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	And so having data is really important. And it has been often observed that 80% of the effort associated with building an AI system is data wrangling, or data architecture, as we call it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=1817.84s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	We tend to encourage people to use TSV, which stands for tab separated values, because we can replace the comma with a tab. And that allows us to write higher performance readers and writers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=2417.11s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	There's other languages-- Julia, MATLAB, Octave, R-- many other languages that play important roles in data analysis. We've talked about Jupyter Notebooks, which is a universal interface to these different languages and libraries to allow you to do data analysis in addition to the various machine learning tools.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=2507.86s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	Fortunately, we've discovered some ways that we can basically convert these hierarchical formats into a giant, what we call, sparse table. And sparse just means a table where lots of the values are empty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=2602.06s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	That's the code that, basically, puts the data into that folder. And then, with the next folder here, parse, this is the code that takes this raw data and parses it and puts it into this folder.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=3273.52s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	And again, allows your teams to contribute quickly to projects. And then, finally, we'll add a little thing here, which is a data file list. This is a list of the full names of all the data files because, especially on our systems, people are often processing lots of data, which contain millions of files.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=3337.15s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	Most data that you will deal with starts out unusable and unshareable, that is, the data is not suited for the purpose that you wanted to use it for, and you do not have permission to share with anybody.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=3444.4s
2. Cyber Network Data Processing; AI Data Architecture	So you want to find that. Then, you want to get a sample or a copy of the data to your team to assess. It is always good to do good opsec, which is good operational security, which means fewer accounts, fewer people having access is better.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPlj2HnuWg#t=3505.36s
0. Examples Demonstration	So I'm going to walk you through some really rudimentary stuff here in this example. So one of the things in D4M that you're dealing with a lot is lists of strings-- long list of strings, millions of distinct strings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5SjikeOHr0#t=367.4s
0. Examples Demonstration	Associative arrays never store an empty row or an empty column. That is a big difference between traditional sparse linear algebra and associative arrays. In sparse linear algebra, you could have a row of all zero-- an empty row or an empty column, not an associative arrays.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5SjikeOHr0#t=1132.7s
Demonstration 7	And it was probably about 80 kilobytes of input data. And that's just because we've compressed all the row keys into single vectors. And we have the sparse adjacency matrix, which stores things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmj5TfFCLY#t=769.52s
Demonstration 7	And I would suggest that you put your name-- instead of having my name there, you put your name there. And then we have a special command you're called DB Setup LLGrid, which basically creates a binding to a database just using the name of the database.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmj5TfFCLY#t=1249.39s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	First, that we should not confuse with each other. One is the concept of narrow AI, and another is a concept of general AI. And sometimes in conversation, we tend to conflate or mix the two. So narrow AI, according to our definition, is the theory and development of computer systems that perform tasks that augment for human intelligence, such as perceiving, classifying, learning, abstracting, reasoning, and/or acting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=184.74s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	And certainly within the context of a lot of the projects that we are interested in, all of this also needs to be wrapped in a layer that we call robust AI, which consists of explainable artificial intelligence, metrics, and biased assessment, verification, validation, security, policy, ethics, safety, and training. We'll talk very briefly about each of these pieces in detail in a little bit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=396.9s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	And this led to the next era or next wave of AI technologies, which is often called the learning wave. And this was really enabled by lots of data-enabled non-expert systems. So what we mean by that is we were able to dial back the amount of expert knowledge that we encoded into the algorithm, maybe put a higher level of expert knowledge into that. But usually, then used data to learn what some of these rules could be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=605.3s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	And there are many other cases. Again, coming back to some of the research I did on autonomous vehicles, we were able to maybe use some high-level expert rules, that here are a set of states that a car may be in. But I'm going to let the algorithm actually figure out when these transitions occur and what constitutes a transition between different states.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=657.339s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	So looking at the four vectors that you could think about it, these systems had a little bit more on perception. Obviously, we're doing a lot more learning. But their ability to abstract and reason was still pretty low. And by reasoning, we mean, can you explain? Can you tell us what's going on when you give me an output to the result? The next wave which we're maybe at the beginning stages of is what we call contextual learning or contextual adaptation. This is where an AI system can actually add context into what it's doing. I'm not sure I have too many examples of people doing this very well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=677.57s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	So, again, I'm talking about a few data sets that I'm very familiar with. The unstructured data can often be 90% of the volume. And maybe the 10% is the metadata associated with the unstructured data. Most of the value, however, comes from the structured data where people really analyze the crap out of these structured data, because they know how to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=1327.499s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	I'm sure many of you are very familiar with it. And I know a few of you are far more knowledgeable about this, maybe than I am. But some of the key features would be explainable AI, which is a system being able to describe what it's doing in an interpretable fashion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=2350.109s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	Machine learning is a combination of techniques from statistics, computer, and computer science communities. And it's the idea of getting computers to program themselves. Common tasks within the world of machine learning could be things like classification, regression, prediction, clustering, et cetera.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=2603.63s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	In the case of supervised learning, you're providing labels, which is the correct label associated with an input feature or with an input data set or data point. In unsupervised learning, you typically have no labels, but also are limited by what the algorithm itself can do.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=2693.03s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	And you have two general goals. One is in regression, which is to predict some continuous variable or a classification, which is to predict a class or label. So if we look at this, the diagram on the right, we have training data that we provide, which is data and labels.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=2882.349s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	That goes into a trained model. That's typically an iterative process where we find out, well, did we do a good job? That is now called a supervised learning model that we then apply new data, or test data, or unseen data and look at the predicted labels.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=2901.13s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	Typically, when you are designing an algorithm like this, you'd separate out. You'd take your training data. You'd remove a small portion of it that you do know the labels for. That's your test data over here. And then you run that. And you can see, well, is it working well or not? And most of these algorithms have a training step that forms a model. So when we talk about machine learning in both the supervised and unsupervised sense, we'll often talk about training the model, which is this process, and then inference, which is the second step, which is where you apply unseen data. So this is the trained model in deployment or in the field. It's performing inference at that point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=2917.539s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	We might talk about this in-- are we talking about this on day three? We might talk a little bit about it. But there is model parallelism, which is I have the model itself distributed across multiple pieces. And I want to adjust different pieces of the model at the same time. There's research and lots of results. I think we might even have some examples that people are doing with that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=3653.7s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	AUDIENCE: Have you got some examples on the [INAUDIBLE] approach, the [INAUDIBLE] approach? VIJAY GADEPALLY: A little bit earlier. AUDIENCE: Communication [INAUDIBLE]. VIJAY GADEPALLY: So there are many different ways to parallelize it. One would be data parallelism, which is I take my big data set or big data point, and I distribute that across my different nodes. And each one independently learns a model that works well. And then I do some synchronization across these different pieces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=3676.88s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	Some common techniques are within clustering and data projection. Clustering is the basic idea that we want to group objects or sets of features, such that objects in the same cluster are more similar to those of another cluster. And what you typically do for that is you put your data in some feature space, and you try to maximize some intracluster measure, which is basically saying, I want the points within my cluster to be closer than anything outside of my cluster, right? So that's a metric. And you iteratively move the membership from each. You set a number of clusters, saying, I need five clusters. It'll randomly assign things. And it'll keep adjusting the membership of a particular data point within a cluster, based on a metric such as the squared error.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=3983.74s
1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning	So in this example, we might say that, OK, these are three clusters that I get out of it. Dimensionality reduction is the idea of reducing the number of random variables under consideration. Very often, you'll collect a data set that has hundreds to thousands of different features.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4K6lney7Zw#t=4029.72s
4. Examples Demonstration	The string values are those character positions. We don't really care about those. So we're going to just get rid of them and just convert it to a numeric like we've always been doing here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJ7TQb5Fuk#t=361.56s
4. Examples Demonstration	And again, then we're just getting the columns. Again, this thing returns an associative array. This equal equals returns the associative array of all things that are equal to that. And then we can look at the columns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJ7TQb5Fuk#t=879.4s
4. Analysis of Structured Data	And this particular database is a row oriented database, which means it can look up any row key with constant access. So it can look up row keys very quickly. And D4M a lot we hide this from you so that whenever you do inserts it does, if you want it to happen, it will store the transpose for you.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkcj6JrhGy8#t=276.53s
4. Analysis of Structured Data	I said I've allowed column types. So we're going to be interested in certain column types. And we're going to create a set of clutter columns. These are columns that we want to ignore.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkcj6JrhGy8#t=892.4s
4. Analysis of Structured Data	And you're concerned that's just going to-- you don't want to get, you don't want New York, but you happen to be on the same latitude and longitude of New York. You can do something called Mertonization, which basically is essentially imagine taking your strings of your coordinates and interleaving them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkcj6JrhGy8#t=1478.62s
7. Kronecker Graphs, Data Generation, and Performance	And so there's times when you want to understand the structure of these things. Very useful theoretical tool for doing that. If instead, we use our C graph, instead of it being 1's and 0's, it contains, say, numbers between 0 and 1 that are probabilities, the probability of creating an edge between those two vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTakzGAhYvo#t=670.67s
7. Kronecker Graphs, Data Generation, and Performance	That talks about inserts. Another thing that we also want to look at is queries. So as I said before, Accumulo is a row-based store, which means if you give it a row key, it will return the result in constant time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTakzGAhYvo#t=1744.71s
0. Introduction	So that's another type of set of relationship. Again, very textural and oriented, very much oriented towards words and not numbers. Another area is cyber networks, a very apropros topic that people are, at least everyone is impacted by, and many people are doing work on, which is relationships between computers, communication between web servers, those types of things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=404.57s
0. Introduction	This is sometimes referred to in graph theory as a bipartite graph. It's basically two separate sets, a vertices that talk to each other but have no, at least in this data set, we are not recording any connections within the sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=497.78s
0. Introduction	Likewise, on the experimental side, you know, that's the research that we conduct. MIT actually has large laboratories. Laboratories that are fully peered with the departments. That is actually quite a unique thing for an academic institution to have laboratories and laboratory heads that are right up there with the department heads in how they're positioned.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=806.13s
0. Introduction	And nowadays, computers have gotten a little bit more complicated than the way we used to think about them. We used to think about them typically as a von Neumann machine, which means you had data and operations, you know, bytes and software.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=879.83s
0. Introduction	But finally, we're going to come back to this case where we need a database. And a database is when we have very large amounts of data but we want to access-- database, data that won't fit in our memory, but we want to access in little bits.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=1293.82s
0. Introduction	The traditional definitions of graphs, though, that are taught in most computer science courses, they tend to focus on what we call undirected, unweighted graphs. So these are a graph is a set of vertices and edges, and so what we're saying when we say it's an undirected and unweighted graph is that all the edges are the same between any two vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=1492.06s
0. Introduction	They store all the data as triples, which means we will have a row, and a column, and a value associated with everything. So what we do is we take our dense data, and we do what we call, create an exploded table.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=2329.66s
0. Introduction	And in this case, the databases we will be talking about are almost always row oriented. Which means they can get a row in constant time, give it a row key like this and you can look it up very quickly.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=2445.158s
0. Introduction	And the key to deduction theory is doing correlations. Correlations allow us to determine what the backgrounds of our data are, what the clutter of our data are, and then we are on our way with traditional detection theory, and signal processing techniques, and all the things that we know we love.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGKX-4PRsk#t=2736.66s
9. Reducibility	So as you recall from last time, we had this problem HALT TM, which is the problem of testing for a given Turing machine and an input to that Turing machine, whether the Turing machine halts, either accepting or rejecting, but just whether it halts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=218.83s
9. Reducibility	OK, so the concept of reducibility is that we say one problem is reducible to another, say A reducible to B. It means that you can use B to solve A. That's what it means for A to be reducible to B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=530.05s
9. Reducibility	But from your homework, we had this pusher problem, the problem of determining whether a pushdown automaton ever pushes on its stack for any input. I know a bunch of you were struggling with that problem working on it, hopefully solving it in one way or another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=708.41s
9. Reducibility	They are all equivalent. And now we're going to use this notion of a function that you can compute to define a kind of reducibility called mapping reducibility. I'm going to say that A is mapping reducible to B, written with this less than or equal to sub M symbol.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=2242.15s
9. Reducibility	And you think of you're trying to solve A. You're trying to decide membership in A. So you want to test whether w is in A or not. A mapping reducible is a function which maps things from this space over to that space in a way that strings that are in A get mapped to strings that are in B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=2299.14s
9. Reducibility	And for that reason, it's not always going to be useful to prove Turing unrecognizability. It's better for proving undecidability. So what we're calling reducibility, or general reducibility is where we just use a solvent for B to solve A in sort of a most general possible way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=3274.09s
9. Reducibility	And the thing that's going to do the trick is going to be that same reduction function that we saw earlier. We're going to take that machine w from before, the machine that filters out all the non-w's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=3969.65s
9. Reducibility	So these are two different f's. I'm going to make f here. Instead of generating Tw and T reject, I'm going to have Tw and T accept which is a Turing machine that always accepts its input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N28g_YBXY8Y#t=4269.91s
10. Computation History Method	Good. All right. So why don't we continue. Now, we're all ready to start defining computation histories, which themselves are not very difficult concept. Computation history for a Turing machine M on an input w is just the sequence of configurations you go through.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGqoLm2aAgc#t=1358.47s
10. Computation History Method	That's what we mean by a computation history, or sometimes we're going to emphasize that by calling it an accepting computation history. Represent meaning that the machine has accepted its input, and these are the sequence of configurations that the machine goes through.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGqoLm2aAgc#t=1420.71s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	A Turing machine can recognize a language, the collection of old strings that it accepts. And if the Turing machine always halts, we say it decides the language, and it's a decider, and so therefore, that language is a decided language, a Turing decider.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=242.65s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	That's going to be a decidable language too. And now we have Turing machine A-- DANFA, the decider for ANFA that decides ANFA. OK? So now, as promised, here's our new form for writing our Turing machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=1044.099s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	And EDFA is the DFAs that have empty language, so I should be accepting those. If there's no way to get to an accept state, no accept state is marked. And reject if some accept state earmark, because then the language is not empty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=1693.2s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	I'm going to prove it in an entirely different way, which doesn't require any analysis at all-- no proving something about balance. I'm going to take advantage of something we've already shown, which is I'm going to make a new finite automaton, a new DFAC built out of A and B, which accepts all the strings on which A and B disagree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=1991.255s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	So I'm going to make a machine, a DFAC where the language of C is exactly that symmetric difference. It's all the strings in A intersected with the strings that are not in B-- so in A and not in B-- or in B and not-- then not an A-- take the union of those two parts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=2079.139s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	And so I'll help you through that. Remember-- you should remember, but you may not have looked at it-- something called Chomsky normal form, which is for context-free grammars, but only allows the rules to be of a special kind.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=2600.18s
7. Decision Problems for Automata and Grammars	Now we're going to use that to prove a corollary, which is important for understanding how everything fits together. And that corollary states that every context-free language is a decidable language. Every context-free language is decidable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgN6uxd4i4#t=2844.33s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	We've been looking at finite automata and regular languages. Those are the languages that finite automata can recognize. And we talked about nondeterminism. So we had non-deterministic finite automata and deterministic finite automata.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=42.57s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	We showed that they're equivalent. We looked at the closure properties over the regular operations union, concatenation, and star, and showed that the regular language is really-- the class of regular languages is closed under those regular operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=59.76s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	So this is going to be a nondeterministic machine. There might be several different ways of processing the input. And if any one of them gets to an accepting state at the end of the input, we say the GNFA accepts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=551.93s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	So if you take the language B, where these are strings-- well, let's assume our alphabet is zeros and ones. B is the language of all strings that have an equal number of zeros and ones.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=2040.48s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	And so now we know that the string-- the language 0 star 1 star is a regular language, because it's described by a regular expression. If you take the B, which is the equal numbers of zeros and ones, and you intersect it with 0 star 1 star, that's going to be a regular language if B was regular, using closure under intersection.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=3547.17s
3. Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions	But this language B intersect 0 star 1 star is the language of equal numbers of zeros and ones where the zeros come first. And that's the language D that we showed two slides back, that we already know can't be regular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAySmSEGc9U#t=3571.74s
26. coNP is a subset of IP	Let me hold off on that for now what the degree is. I'll answer the questions in a second. So now remember from before, number phi was the number of satisfying assignments when I preset the first i values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEXSv0jChO4#t=2015.18s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	And so, the one-tape Turing machine is a reasonable choice. Given that, we defined time complexity classes, the TIME[T(n)] classes. We defined the class P, which was invariant among all of those different deterministic models in the sense that it didn't matter which model we choose, we were going to end up with the same class P. So that argues for its naturalness.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=112.69s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	So with that, let's move into today's content, which is, well, just a quick review. As I mentioned, we defined the time complexity class. The time complexity class is a collection of all of the languages that you can solve in a certain time bound, within a certain amount of time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=181.08s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	So the time n-squared, for example, is all of the languages or all of the problems that you can solve in n-squared time. We're identifying problems with languages here. And the class P is the collection of all problems that you can solve or all languages that you can solve in polynomial time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=211.95s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	So now we're going to define the analogous complexity class associated to non-deterministic computation, which we'll call non-deterministic time. So non-deterministic time T of n is the set of all languages that you can do with a non-deterministic machine that runs in order T of n time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=586.18s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	And by analogy with what we did before, the class NP is the collection of all languages that you can do non-deterministically in polynomial time. So it's the union over all of the ntime classes where the bound is polynomial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=685.15s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	And we'll return now to this notion of NP corresponding to easy verifiability. NP are the languages where you can easily verify membership quickly. I'll try to explain what that means. In contrast, P are the languages where you can test membership quickly.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=1768.75s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	That's not going to be relevant for us. So let's not think about that. How does a Turing machine perform division? How does a Turing machine perform division? Well, how do you perform division? [LAUGHS] Long division is an operation that can run in-- the long division procedure that you learn in grade school, you can implement that on a Turing machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=2359.935s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	Since I've spent some time thinking-- I'm known as having spent some time thinking about it. People claim to solve the problem, solve P is NP, the P versus NP problem, by basically saying, problems like Hamiltonian path or other similar problems, basically there's clearly no way to solve them without searching through a lot of possibilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=2662.55s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	Not memorization. Came from the same root, I think, but memoization, which is somehow remembering the results of a computation so you don't have to repeat it. The total number of calls is going to be, at most, n squared, to this algorithm, because you're never going to be redoing work that you've done already.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=3500.9s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	I'm assuming that you've all seen Boolean algebra, Boolean arithmetic before, where the and operation is only true if both inputs are true. These are going to be binary and operations and binary or operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=4136.649s
14. P and NP, SAT, Poly-Time Reducibility	But with the right definition, the answer is yes. So you can define a verifier as a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate, that takes a certificate and an input to the language, and will accept if that certificate is a valid certificate for that input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhnDdQsELo#t=4625.18s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	One of those variables is going to be a computation history-- an integer which represents the computation history for m on W. And the other variables are there to help you kind of decode that so that the polynomial can actually check and make a solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=129.6s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	What do we mean by that? I mean a machine-- I'm going to call it SELF-- which ignores its input. So on any input, you turn it on, the machine grinds around for a while, and halts with a description of itself on the tape-- with the description of SELF, its own code, sitting on the tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=592.36s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	It sees some string on the tape. A is the machine that prints out that string. A is q of this string. So B is simply going to compute q of whatever it sees on the tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=1018.05s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	In the Turing machine, which is the action and which is the template, and in the sentence, which is the action and which is the template. The action is the part where there's some interesting sort of instructional stuff happening that you have to carry out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=1613.623s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	And so remember, enumerators, you can enumerate exactly all the recognizable languages. So I'm going to assume I have an enumerator for this language, which just prints out all of the minimal Turing machines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=3066.12s
11. Recursion Theorem and Logic	OK, mathematical logic is the mathematical study of mathematics itself. Godel's first incompleteness theorem, as we described, is that in any reasonable formal system of mathematical provability, there are going to be some true statements that are not provable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-_XmLanPYg#t=3805.24s
15. NP-Completeness	So in the direction of exploring this question and its ramifications, we introduced this problem called SAT. These are the Boolean formulas, which have an assignment that makes them evaluate to true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=256.22s
15. NP-Completeness	So we take these clauses, which themselves are ORs-- we and them together, we get a formula that's conjunctive normal form. Conjunctive stands for and, I think. Conjunction is an and. And then a 3CNF is a CNF where each clause has exactly three literals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=600.63s
15. NP-Completeness	And a 3SAT problem-- so this is the first of the two problems we're going to be talking about-- the 3SAT problem is the satisfiability problem restricted to these 3CNF formulas. So this is the collection of-- set of 3CNF formulas which are satisfiable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=639.46s
15. NP-Completeness	So for that we-- going to turn to graph theory. So we're going to consider graphs, points and lines-- connecting them. And we will say that a clique in a graph is a collection of nodes-- collection of the points that are all pairwise connected by lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=697.45s
15. NP-Completeness	And a k-clique is one where you have k such nodes. So here we have a three clique, four clique, and a five clique. And then the clique problem is to try to find cliques of a certain specified size embedded within a given graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=718.5s
15. NP-Completeness	Verifying means you can verify something if you're given a certificate. In the case of a clique-- the clique problem-- the certificate is the clique. So once you have the certificate, you can do the verification in polynomial time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=1070.92s
15. NP-Completeness	Obviously, satisfiability means that the-- you can find an assignment to the variables. So you're going to set each of these variables-- A, B, and C, and so on-- to true or false, and you want to make the whole formula evaluate the true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=1194.05s
15. NP-Completeness	k is the number of clauses exactly when phi was satisfied. It's kind of cool. If phi is satisfiability, then there will be a k-clique here. And if phi was not satisfiability-- no k-clique.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=1603.47s
15. NP-Completeness	And this is the way the global structure of G is going to look like. Now, I'm getting a question here. What do those horizontal nodes-- what role do they play? Those nodes are there to allow me to visit those clause nodes, the nodes which represent the clause gadgets, which I'm going to place over here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4211.17s
15. NP-Completeness	These are spacers that separate the detours from one another, and that force a visit to the clause node to come back to the same place from which it left. Otherwise, you would never be able to visit those spacer nodes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4548.76s
15. NP-Completeness	These are the so-called clause gadgets, which are going to force there to be one true literal in every clause for the satisfying assignment. You have to look at it, or maybe we can spend a little bit more time explaining it, but that's what the purpose is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4632.04s
15. NP-Completeness	Is everything either NP complete or in P? So for one thing, there are problems that are not known to be in either category. So we'll discuss some of those in due course, but one of them is the graph isomorphism problem, testing two graphs-- if they're really just permutations of one another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZPzBHGDsWI#t=4887.89s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	That would imply that an NP-complete problem would have that property. And so proving a problem being NP-complete is evidence, very strong evidence, that it doesn't have a polynomial time solution. And so therefore it's called intractable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=132.66s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	But I'm going to do it in the form of a check-in. So I'm sure you've all seen the big sum notation using a big sigma to represent a sum over some set of possibilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=310.99s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	This is not a sigma. This is a gamma. Gamma is the tape alphabet. This is any symbol, including an input symbol, from sigma is going to be in gamma. So this is any symbol can appear on the tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=1971.69s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	So let's look at what I mean by a legal neighborhood. So a legal neighborhood is a setting of the values, the six values of this 2 by 3 neighborhood, in a way which doesn't violate M's rules.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=3023.18s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	And that's going to be logically equivalent to saying that A implies B. Another logical equivalence may be more familiar to you. It's just simply De Morgan's law, which says that if you have the not of A AND B, that's equivalent to saying the not of A or the not of B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=4110.109s
16. Cook-Levin Theorem	Logically equivalent means that it gives you exactly the same function. If you set the variables in the same way, you get the same result coming out. Well, phi prime has more variables than phi does.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Az1gtDRaAU#t=4524.78s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	I encourage you to think about that for a minute if not immediately obvious. But those are the strings that are going to be accepted by this machine. And we call that collection of strings the language of the machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=898.82s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	Sigma is the alphabet symbols of the automaton, another finite set. Delta is the transition function. That tells us how the automaton moves from state to state. Those describes how those transition arrows-- those arrows which connected the states with each other-- it describes them in a mathematical way instead in terms of a picture.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1219.89s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	And the way I'm doing that is with a function. So delta is a function which takes two things. So I'm hoping you've seen this notation before. I'll help you through it once, but this is the kind of thing I would expect you to have seen already.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1245.51s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	We're not going to talk about that. Maybe rarely, we'll make it very clear, we'll talk about an infinite string, but that's going to be an exception. And a language is a set of strings.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1474.21s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	They're not even of the same type of object. So don't confuse them with one another. I mean, you can have a set, a language, which has just one element, which is the empty string.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=1531.31s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	Like the union operation, for example, that's one you probably have seen before. The union of two languages here is a collection of strings that are in either one or the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2059.0s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	And the last of the regular operations is the so-called star operation, which is a unary operation. It applies to just a single language. And so what you do is now you're going to take-- to get a member of the star language, you're going to take a bunch of strings in the original language, A, you stick them together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2117.51s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	So this is something you're going to see frequently. Sigma star means this is the language of all strings over the alphabet we're working with at that moment. Now, if you take sigma star 1, you just concatenate 1 onto all of the elements of sigma star, and that's going to give you all strings that end with a 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2411.763s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	So sigma star 1 is all strings that end with 1. Or, for example, you take sigma star 11 sigma star, that is all strings that contain 11. And we already saw that language once before.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2450.79s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	Can we get empty string from empty set? Yeah. There are a bunch of exotic cases, by the way. So empty language star is the language which has just the empty string.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=2587.14s
1. Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions	So this is the collection of pairs of states, q1 and q2, where q1 is in the state of the first machine, q2 is the state of the second machine. The start state is you start at the two start states of the two machines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9syvZr-9xwk#t=3102.33s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	You just want to make sure that, when you're picking the repetition R, the two R's here, you pick the lowest possible repetitions that occur, if you have many choices. And those lowest two, those lowest repetitions, there is not going to be any lower repetition here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=1938.49s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	And so just to make sure we were on the same page on this, the language of the machine is the collection of strings that the machine accepts. So the things that are not in the language are the things that are rejected either by looping or by halting and rejecting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4000.87s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	So only the ones that are accepted is the language. Every machine has just a single language. It's the language of all strings that that machine accepts. And we'll say that and recognize that language, if that language is the collection of such strings that are accepted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4019.84s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	We'll say that, instead of just recognizing the language, we'll say that it decides the language. And the Turing-decidable language is a language that the machine-- of all strings the machine accepts for some Turing machine which is a decider, which is a Turing machine that always halts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4135.76s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	So we haven't shown this inclusion yet. But actually, this is the picture that we get. So there is actually a hierarchy of containments here. Regular languages are a subset of the context-free languages, which are, in turn, a subset of the decidable languages, which in turn, are a subset of the Turing-recognizable languages.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4237.18s
5. CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines	And we defined Turing deciders, Turing machine deciders that halt on all inputs. OK, so I think, with that, we have come to the end of today's lecture. I will stick around a little bit and answer questions in the chat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycOPFmEQk8#t=4283.93s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	But because of the probabilistic nature of the machine, it might get the wrong answer on some branches. And so we say that a machine decides a language with a certain error probability, means that the probability of getting the wrong answer is going to be, at most, that error probability epsilon over all of the possible inputs to the machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=266.05s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	A typical way that people implement randomness in an algorithm is to use a pseudo random number generator, which is a procedure that might give you some kind of a value that looks random, but may not actually be random.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=482.37s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	And testing that is a coNP complete problem, as you're asked to show on your homework. Now, if the branching program, however, has a restriction, namely, that it's not allowed to ask to query the same variable more than once on a path, then with that restriction, we call it a read-once branching program.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=796.64s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	So by following the 1s, it's like the breadcrumbs in Hansel and Gretel. This is the path you need to follow to get through the machine. The 0s are the places where you don't go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=1090.95s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	All right. So let's continue. All right. So now, I'm going to talk about how we're going to extend this to the non-Boolean case, using the arithmetization method. So first of all, arithmetization is a simulation of and and or with plus and times, such that if I think about true as a 1 and false as a 0, this is going to give me a faithful simulation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=1340.64s
24. Probabilistic Computation (cont.)	All right, so let's continue. Good, all right. So now everybody's back, I hope? Let's talk about moving forward here. Where we're going with this is we want to analyze the algorithm, which picks a random non-Boolean input and evaluates the two branching programs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1HD9rqEB4#t=3202.74s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] MICHAEL SIPSER: Welcome, everyone. Welcome back to theory of computation. And just to recap where we are, we have been looking at time complexity and space complexity. And we just finished proving what are called the hierarchy theorems, which, in a nutshell, basically say that, if you allow the computational model to have a little bit more resource, a little bit more time, a little bit more space, then you can do more things with certain conditions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=0.0s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	OK. So the time and space hierarchy theorems-- because we're going to be using those today-- they say that if you give a little bit more space here-- so for space constructible functions, functions that you can actually compute within the amount of space that they specify, you can show that the things that you can do in that much space is probably larger than what you can do in less space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=122.39s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	So a rejecting computation history is the sequence of configurations the machine goes through from the start configuration until it ends up at a configuration with a reject state, a rejecting configuration.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=1635.34s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	So we have a lot of Greek letters to play with, so we're going to use delta for the alphabet that we write the computation histories in. If you want to get reminded what that delta is, a computation history can have a tape alphabet symbol for M, it can have a state symbol for M, or it can have a delimiter pound-- hashtag.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=1740.622s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	Looks like this. So any string that doesn't start with these symbols, doesn't start exactly like this, should be described by bad start, that regular expression. So that, in itself, is going to be further subdivided.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=2456.52s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	Especially because they're going to tell us something interesting about methods, which may or may not be useful for proving the P versus NP question, when someday somebody hopefully does that. What is an oracle? An oracle is free information you're going to give to a Turing machine, which might affect the difficulty of solving problems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=3468.008s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	So that's what we-- the terminology that people usually use is sometimes called relativism, or computation relative to having this extra information. So P with an A oracle is all of the language that you can decide in polynomial time if you have an oracle for A. Let's see.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=3639.02s
22. Provably Intractable Problems, Oracles	But now that I have the SAT oracle, it's going to make it possible where before it was not possible. So let's just understand what I mean by that. If I'm trying to do the non minimal formulas, namely the formulas that do have a shorter equivalent formula.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32bnUliSzo#t=3840.71s
18. PSPACE-Completeness	So getting back to what we've been doing. We've been talking about space complexity. Measures how much memory the algorithm requires or various problems require. And we defined the space complexity classes, space f of n and non-deterministic space f of n, the polynomial space and non-deterministic space classes, and gave some examples and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVv9WXwW95w#t=41.28s
18. PSPACE-Completeness	And let's just try to be clear on the algorithm to solve the ladder DFA problem. So if you remember, first of all, let me just jump on ahead. The ladder problem is-- a ladder, first of all, is a sequence of strings that change one symbol at a time that perhaps connect, go from one string to another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVv9WXwW95w#t=352.29s
18. PSPACE-Completeness	So it's going to be log t levels before we get down to 1. Yeah. So somebody is asking, can we think of this as a memory stack? Yes, this is like-- that's the way your typical implementation of recursion is kind of with a stack, where you push when you make a call and you pop when you return from the call.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVv9WXwW95w#t=1355.2s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	One was about the ladder problem, where you're trying to see if you can get from one string to another string changing one symbol at a time. And all of the strings were in the language of some finite automaton, or you had some reasonable rule for saying which are the valid strings, which are not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=51.76s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	And then we built on that idea. We showed Savitch's theorem, that going from any nondeterministic machine to a deterministic machine only squares the amount of space. And then we finally proved that TQBF, this problem about quantified Boolean formulas, testing whether they are true, that that problem is complete for PSPACE.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=73.09s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	"But a forced win is also called a ""winning strategy."" That just means that if both sides play optimally, they play the best possible-- not of their capability, I mean absolutely the best possible play-- then that Player I would still win."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=509.82s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	I'm not sure what else, what other why I can answer there. I'm going to answer some of the most basic questions here. Somebody is asking, how do we know how many variables to use? So the variables are the variables of the formula.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=1737.22s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	So if you take this formula here-- this is some particular formula, Exist x for all y, blah, blah, blah. There's going to be associated to that formula, a formula game where first Exist moves, assigns a value for x, and depending upon that value, For All is going to move and is going to assign a value for y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=1948.87s
19. Games, Generalized Geography	So log space are the things that you can do when you only have enough space to write down, essentially, a pointer or some fixed number of pointers into the input. That's what you get when you have logarithmic space, because log space is enough to write down an index of something.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dFPVJrNLDs#t=3470.64s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	Again, just as before, the machine may accept 0 strings, one string, many strings, but it always has one language, the collection of all accepted strings. Now, if you have a decider, which is a machine that never loops, which always halts on every input, then we say its language is a decidable language.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=299.14s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	So a multi-tape Turing machine is a Turing machine, as you might imagine, that has more than one-- well, has one or possibly more tapes. And so a single tape Turing machine would be a special version of a multi-tape Turing machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=442.83s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	Now, the language of the machine is the collection of all strings that it ever prints out. So we're defining language in a somewhat different way here. It's not the strings that it accepts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=1960.84s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	It produces the language rather than accepts the strings in the language. It's not really a recognizer. It's a generator. And the language of the machine, as writing over here, for an enumerator here, we say its language is a collection of strings that it prints.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=1985.62s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	We'll start off with the easier direction. Let's say we have an enumerator. Hopefully you got this concept of this Turing machine which periodically prints strings when you started it off on the empty tape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=2031.62s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	But just to make things even worse, I have a check in, which is going to be about this one little point here. So I got a question. Where do we get the wi strings? The wi strings are simply the list of all strings in sigma star.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=2411.49s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	But if you look him up on Wikipedia, where I get all my information, he actually, and I knew this anyway, he has a very famous paper, an influential paper, on how, for example, spots arise on leopards and stripes on tigers and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=3253.46s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	Some of these we'll talk about later. But the 10th problem here is about algorithms. The 10th problem on Hilbert's list called Hilbert's 10th problem is a problem about algorithms. And it says give an algorithm for solving what are called Diophantine equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=3417.3s
6. TM Variants, Church-Turing Thesis	The Church-Turing thesis. Somebody asked me, is it proved in the book? There's nothing to prove. The Church-Turing thesis is an equivalence between the intuitive and the formal. You can't prove something like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTArY7ojshU#t=4339.87s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	But until someone has a proof that they're different, strange things can happen. OK. So with that, I will move myself into the corner. And let's do our review. So we are-- in order to talk about space complexity classes that are smaller than n, we had to introduce a new model, which was the two-tape model, where there was a read-only tape that had the input on it, which you normally would think of something very large-- the whole internet, or something so big that you can't read it into your local memory.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=146.66s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	We're not going to be measuring time. We're only going to be focusing on how much space we're using. Another example that we gave is the PATH language, where you're given a graph, and a start node, and a target node.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=299.71s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	And so it's really the same idea that says that PATH really captures any NL machine. The computation of any NL machine really can be seen as a PATH problem, where the nodes are the configurations of the machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=2597.15s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	So let's just see how-- let me just try to go through that if that wasn't super clear, which I'm not sure it was. So suppose we have a machine decided by-- a language decided by a nondeterministic-- an NL machine, a nondeterministic machine in log space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=2621.2s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	But what we're going to give is a NL machine, a nondeterministic machine, which is going to compute this function. And therefore, you can use that to do the PATH language. Two important things for us is, if G is some graph, well, here's the starting node, s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=3771.9s
20. L and NL, NL = coNL	R is all of the nodes that you can reach from s. This is some collection of nodes. And c, which stands for count, is the number of reachable nodes. So I've written that down here more-- if you like it more formally.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3xvno_KgRY#t=3794.41s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	I'll talk a little bit about the problem set. And we'll also have a break, as requested, halfway through. So why don't we jump in? What we did last time was besides introducing the course, we introduced finite automata in regular languages, which are the languages that the finite automata can recognize.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=49.84s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So that means we have machines, finite automata, for A1 and A2. We'll call them M1 and M2, that recognize A1 and A2, respectively. And then what we need to do in order to show the concatenation is regular is to make a finite automaton which recognizes the concatenation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=229.2s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	If any one of the states as possibilities that we are right now at the end of the string is an accept state, then we say, overall, the machine has accepted. So that corresponds to what we said over here before-- accept the input if some path leads to an accept.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=833.94s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So here we have what's called a power set. That's the set of subsets of the collection Q. So here we're going to produce an entire subset of states. Instead of just one state coming out, there might be a subset of possible states that you can go to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=1354.57s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So M prime is going to be bigger. OK. So quickly, the construction of M, the states of M prime now, q prime, are going to be the power set, the set of subsets of states from the original machine M.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=1869.315s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So they're not a pair of languages, because a star is a unary operation applying to just a single language. So if we have a DFA recognizing A, in order to show that A star is regular, we have to construct a machine that recognizes A star.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=2677.982s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	Star means you can take as many copies of you lot as you like of strings in the original language, and that's in the star language. So to determine if something is in the star language, you have to see, can I break it up into pieces which are all in the original language? So you want to see, can I take my input w and cut it up into a bunch of pieces-- four, in this case-- where each of those pieces are members of A, the members of the original language? So that's what M prime's job is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=2732.22s
2. Nondeterminism, Closure Properties, Conversion of Regular Expressions to FA	So this machine accepts just the empty string. Or its language is the language with one element, the empty string. How about the empty language? Well, here's an NFA which has no accepting state, so it can't be accepting anything.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsscmUwjMU#t=3341.75s
8. Undecidability	If not, we will delay that part until next Tuesday's lecture. All right, acceptance problem for Turing Machines. So just as I mentioned, we showed that A,TM, which is the language of Turing machines and inputs where the machine accepts the input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=119.02s
8. Undecidability	So a one-to-one function is a function that's mapping from A to B. Those are the two sets whose sizes we're trying to compare. And the function being one-to-one just means that there are no collisions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=294.18s
8. Undecidability	But yeah, countable or countably infinite, sometimes people say, if it has the same size as the natural numbers. Or otherwise, you have to include the finite sets as well. And countable means you can just go through the elements of the set as a list.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=970.22s
8. Undecidability	We're going to talk about that a little later. So we're going to come back and revisit this argument in a week or so when we talk about the recursion theorem which talks about machines that can refer to themselves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=3139.693s
8. Undecidability	We showed earlier, the regular, the context-free, decidable, recognizable. Here, I've got the recognizable and what I'm calling the co-Turing recognizable. This is the collection of all complements of recognizable languages. So A,TM bar, A,TM complement is the complement of a recognizable language.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=3619.81s
8. Undecidability	The complement of A,TM is the complement of a recognizable but itself is not recognizable and not decidable. So you got this side of nice, you know-- I hope you think it's nice, but it's sort of a try to summarize things in this little Venn diagram.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzuSPQPEU4#t=4572.45s
12. Time Complexity	And look at the maximum cost, the maximum number of steps you need, to solve any one of those inputs of a given length. And we'll do that for each length. And the way we're going to frame it is in terms of giving a maximum, or what's called an upper bound, on the amount of time that you need to solve all of those inputs of length n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=317.4s
12. Time Complexity	So this is a collection of languages. The time complexity class is a set of languages. I'm going to draw it now as a diagram. So if you take the language, again, that we've been using as our standard example, a to the k, b to the k, that's n time n log n, as we observed two slides to slides back, or three slides back.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=2034.0s
12. Time Complexity	Let's see. Oh, because a bunch of people apparently are asking the TAs why all regular languages can be done in order n. So if you think about a DFA, which processes an input of length n with n steps, and a DFA is I'm going to be a type of Turing machine that never writes on its tape, so if a DFA can do it in n steps, the Turing machine can do it in n steps.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=2610.66s
12. Time Complexity	Cellular automata, which are just arrays of finite automata that can communicate with each other, similarly. All the reasonable deterministic models, again, classical models, I'm not talking about quantum computing, are polynomially related.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=3138.33s
12. Time Complexity	The PATH language, which is where I'm going to give you a graph G, two nodes in the graph, s and t, where I'm thinking of G as a directed graph. So directed means that the connections between the nodes in G are going to be directed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=3502.73s
12. Time Complexity	So I'm looking for a path that goes, that hits every node of G, not just the shortest, most direct path. But in a sense, the most indirect path, the longest path that goes through from s to t that visits everything else along the way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=4044.75s
12. Time Complexity	A path of that kind, that hits every node of the graph is called a Hamiltonian path. Because the mathematician Hamilton studied those and made some definitions about that. I'm not going to-- I don't actually know the history there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=4059.57s
12. Time Complexity	MICHAEL SIPSER: Yeah, so we actually-- we're going to-- we will talk about Oracle Turing machines later on in the term. These are machines that have access to sort of free information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjAc90L8rE#t=4976.06s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So I did the last row or two a bit fast. Just because the pattern's there, and you'll spot it. Now I want to pull out of that the matrix. The Fourier matrix, the four by four Fourier matrix that multiplies the c's and gives me the f's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bElQTlIWCr8#t=606.53s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	OK, so. Pretty full day again. I had last time introduced the Fourier matrix, the discrete Fourier transform. Well, more strictly, the discrete Fourier transform is usually this one. It takes the function values and produces the coefficients.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdpdZ0diXUg#t=21.31s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And that's c squared. That's the energy inequality, it's just orthogonality once again. Everything in these weeks is coming out of orthogonality. Orthogonality is the fact that this is N times the identity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdpdZ0diXUg#t=1079.44s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And the issues that come up are the accuracy of the choice. Centered differences often gives you that extra order of accuracy. Stability is something we have not seen yet. So what does stability mean? Stability means that as I follow my difference equation forward in time it stays near the true equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BAMQmT-tf0#t=515.17s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So it's the u, u' plane. The position-velocity plane. Sometimes called the phase plane. I'll just write that word down, phase plane. And what will be our picture here? It starts there, right? u(0) is one, no velocity, starts there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BAMQmT-tf0#t=1769.48s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The boundary condition came up here for A transpose, the boundary condition was w_0=0. That got knocked out, w_0 to be zero. No surprise. Free-fixed, this is the free end at the left, this is the fixed end at the right.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4Gw9No008#t=1385.83s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	A virtual displacement is a little displacement away from u, but it has to satisfy the zero-- the fixed condition that u satisfied. In other words, the little virtual v can't move away from zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4Gw9No008#t=2858.31s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	But the fixed-free or the fixed-fixed, when we have one support or two supports, that removed the all ones solution. Good. Least squares, we assume there weren't any. We assumed-- Because we wanted to work directly with A transpose A, the normal equations, so we assumed that the columns of A were independent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQbq9G__--Y#t=249.04s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Now we're ready for the lecture itself. Graphs and networks. OK, let me start with, what's a graph. A graph is a bunch of nodes and some or all of the edges between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQbq9G__--Y#t=362.33s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Will be the balance equation. The current balance, it's the balance of currents, balance of charge, whatever you like to say. At each node, it's the balance at the nodes. Because when we're up on this line, we're in the node picture.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQbq9G__--Y#t=2319.69s
Rec 11 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Because it hasn't come up in class but it's very important too. It would be the eigenvalue problem. So this is problem number one, the steady state problem when you've got a source and you want to find out the temperature distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkyv1D1tZGg#t=160.27s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Linear problem. I'm asking for the general solution to a linear equation. What's the general set up? General set up is, particular solution plus nullspace solution. Right? You see an equation like that, you're looking for the general solution, tell me one particular solution and then tell me all the solutions when it has zero on the right, and we've got everybody.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwKN0blvNkk#t=2428.59s
Rec 1 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	If there is an A inverse. That's a critical thing as we saw. Is the matrix invertible? The answer here is, yes, there is an inverse. And what does that really mean? The inverse is the thing that takes us from b back to x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oBJN8F616U#t=1095.1s
Rec 1 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Why not? Because I wouldn't be able to multiply that vector by five and I would be away from the point. But the zero subspace, the really small subspace that just has the zero vector, it's got one vector in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oBJN8F616U#t=2696.02s
Rec 9 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Streamlines are lines where the s is constant, so minus 1/2 x squared is constant, what's the picture look like? Picture then, for that, well, and you know what the flow is doing at a typical point here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9cSV3QKz0#t=442.05s
Rec 9 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Faster and faster the other way. It's a important flow. You know, in earthquakes and things like that. This happens, when one plate shears with respect to another. So that's shearing. The word shearing means that a line that was -- that line after a while is tilted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9cSV3QKz0#t=764.92s
Rec 9 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So what's the xx derivative, the second x derivative of that function? Take its derivative with respect to x, and then do it again, and what do you have? Same. Didn't change. e^x is just -- and now what about the second y derivative? So now e^x is just a constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9cSV3QKz0#t=1595.71s
Rec 9 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And I'm looking for what component of w? The normal component, the component of w, w dot n, the component of w that's headed out. n is defined to be, whatever the boundary is -- here I've made it look like a circle but I shouldn't have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9cSV3QKz0#t=2488.43s
Lec 34 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And it's a constant in frequency space. Then there's one more that takes a little trick to do, but it's a very neat one. f(x) is e to the minus x squared over two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv7eOsMVx6E#t=515.85s
Lec 34 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	That x squared is what's making the integral tricky. So from zero to one, we just have to give it a name. So, error function. This would be E-R-F, error function, the integral of that thing correctly normalized.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv7eOsMVx6E#t=635.67s
Lec 34 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Why is the bell-shaped curve so important? That's certainly, we're not going to launch into theory of probability but it's the central limit theorem. So let me just use those words. The central limit theorem that says that if I start with other probability distributions, like I'm flipping a coin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv7eOsMVx6E#t=788.81s
Lec 34 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	You've got to do deconvolution. You've got to do a division to get the G out. May I just say those words and then it's Thanksgiving? That a machine, a sensor which is translation invariant, or you could say close enough to pretend it is, because nothing is going to be perfectly translation invariant all the way out to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv7eOsMVx6E#t=3003.92s
Lec 26 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Actually, Professor Johnson in the Math Department, he created the best FFT code there is. Do you know that? I'll just mention. His code is called FFTW, Fastest Fourier Transform in the West, and the point is it's set up to be fast on whatever computer, whatever architecture you're using.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6sPpQXST5E#t=2441.72s
Rec 2 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	I'm not putting an arbitrary constant on that particular solution. Is one particular solution plus a subspace if I use that language. A lot of solutions to the-- All the solutions to the problem with zero on the right-hand side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hYaOtW4XY4#t=291.3s
Lec 27 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So, that's the future, Fourier. Today is an important day too, finite elements in 2-D, that's a major part of computational science and engineering. The finite element idea, the idea of using polynomials, you can find in some early papers by Courant, a mathematician in New York, and by a guy in China, neat guy named Feng Kang.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYME3EbIqV4#t=117.89s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Running average, it's the most, the first thing you would think of to-- Why would you do such a thing? Why is filtering done? This filter, this averaging filter, would smooth the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnegoNe8Xo#t=481.83s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Suppose an impulse, by an impulse I mean I stick a one in one position and all zeroes. Our usual delta. Our impulse, our spike, is just, suppose the x's have a one here, otherwise all zero, what comes out? Well, suppose there's just x_0 is one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnegoNe8Xo#t=753.71s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	FIR means that the convolution has finite length. OK, now for the question. What is this filter doing to the signal? It's certainly averaging. That's clear. But we want to be more precise.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnegoNe8Xo#t=861.63s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	That's telling me I have a lowpass filter. So that's an expression. That's so simple that you might as well know those words. Lowpass means that the lowest frequencies pass through virtually unchanged.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnegoNe8Xo#t=944.17s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	A good, an ideal filter, an ideal lowpass filter, would do something like this. An ideal filter would stay at one up to some frequency, say pi/2. And drop instantly to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnegoNe8Xo#t=1411.49s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	OK, CT scanner convolves you with their little filter. And then it does a deconvolution, to an approximate deconvolution, to have a better image of you. OK, let's leave that. Can I change direction and just write down the formulas for the Fourier integral transform? And do one example? OK.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnegoNe8Xo#t=2457.23s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So we know zeta(2), we know zeta(4). I don't think we know zeta(3), I think it's not a special number like pi squared over six. So the zeta function, the sum of 1 over n to this thing is, actually that's the subject of a problem that Riemann did not solve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iJryWzLDIw#t=782.53s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And the answer is? One, also one. The delta function, this spike, picks out the value of this function at the spike. Because of course it doesn't matter what that function is away from the spike, because the other factor, delta, is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iJryWzLDIw#t=1034.11s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So those cancel and I get r squared. The length, the size of the number. It's just, if you haven't thought complex just make this change and you're ready to go. Yeah just v bar transpose v, F bar transpose F, if you like, or F squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iJryWzLDIw#t=2106.96s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And the integral of one is x. So now that I would call a ramp function. That's a nice short word for this valuable function. A ramp function is the function that's zero and then x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pw5k0z1L4Q#t=516.81s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The second derivative is the derivative of that jump, so it's got the impulse. So the second derivative, it's a straight line here, second derivative a straight line. This is straight line here, second derivative of a straight line is a straight line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pw5k0z1L4Q#t=595.96s
Rec 8 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So in bending we did integrate by parts. So what did we get? Our bending weak form, our fourth order equation weak form. Say u fourth derivative equal f(x). When I integrated by parts twice, you remember, I had u fourth times a v, times a test function, dx.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUB7FcjaLRI#t=1247.06s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So it has a power series. That makes it a combination of our special ones. The great thing about that series is it converges. So an analytic function, an analytic function is the sum of a power series that converges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMdPZuT7f70#t=1933.21s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And remember, I have this nice-- my curve here is this nice circle. So I'm going to integrate around that circle. First of all, what is n? By definition, n is the normal that points outward, straight out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMdPZuT7f70#t=2610.28s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So this is now the idea of conformal mapping. Change variables. Conformal mapping is a change of variables. He picked some function and let its real part be X and let its imaginary part be Y. Capital Y. OK, this is totally ridiculous to put conformal mapping in 30 seconds.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMdPZuT7f70#t=3070.21s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And what does implicit mean? Implicit means that u_(n+1) is appearing on the right-hand side as well as the left so I've got to move it over and I have to solve a system of equations to find the next u_(n+1).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5EjSvx1vw0#t=331.17s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	That's a reasonable idea. But it's not the least squares idea. So what's the least squares idea? The least squares idea makes the sum of the squares of the errors as small as possible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5EjSvx1vw0#t=2100.63s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And then come back to see why. Because you must see what that equation is. It's the fundamental equation of, this might be called linear regression, fitting data. You're just constantly doing it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5EjSvx1vw0#t=2493.54s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Anybody know his name? Cauchy-Riemann. Yeah. The other name is Riemann. Cauchy-Riemann equations, that connect the two pieces, u and s. And they're the subject of an enormous theory that we'll just touch on here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhLI51d9LDc#t=907.77s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	We're taking powers of something. And that something is what comes out of the blue. It's this quantity, x+iy. Complex variables. Everything here was real until this moment. And then I'm saying that the complex number i, the imaginary number i, the square root of minus one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhLI51d9LDc#t=2363.2s
Rec 12 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so review session on the first part of the Fourier chapter, these two topics that we've done and that homework is now coming on. Fourier series, the classical facts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWrrPuJf2nA#t=20.57s
Rec 12 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Using Black-Scholes, and then what's happened is they now price more and more complicated things. To the point that the banks were buying and selling credit default swaps, insurance swaps, that practically nobody understood what they were.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWrrPuJf2nA#t=1393.79s
Lec 6 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Right? A zero eigenvalue is a signal the matrix isn't invertible. So that's perfect test. If the matrix is invertible, all its eigenvalues are not zero. If it's singular, it's got a zero eigenvalue.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ola674-PPw#t=681.6s
Lec 6 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The sine functions are orthogonal. The sines are orthogonal functions. The sine vectors are orthogonal vectors. I normalize to length one and they go right into my Q. So if I multiply, if I did that times that, that dot product would turn out to be zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ola674-PPw#t=2949.82s
Rec 5 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The special solutions, the pure eigensolutions, the ones that follow their own paths, are the e^(lambda*t)x's, right? Where x is an eigenvector of A, and lambda's an eigenvalue. Those are the guys, and we expect to have n of them, and we expect a combination of those to give us the general solution and to match the boundary conditions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0egP7_kq23E#t=689.12s
Rec 5 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And I mentioned stiff equations. Stiff equations are equations where the eigenvalues lambda are out of scale. You know, you might have two eigenvalues, one of size one and the other of size ten to the fourth, because you've got two physical processes going on at the same time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0egP7_kq23E#t=2675.67s
Rec 5 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Oh yes, OK. Oh yes. AUDIENCE: I figure it's about how these shapes [INAUDIBLE]. see. That has a bunch of figures, so that in order to say for everybody who's not looking at the book, those figures are about the problem we've discussed here with a model problem, where we're on a circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0egP7_kq23E#t=2904.54s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And that's what Ohm's law applies to. Ohm's law says the voltage drop across the resistor times the conductance, so this is Ohm's law, that on that edge the voltage drop across the resistor times the conductance gives the current.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95lUJagN0A#t=408.01s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Do you see the point? Kirchhoff's current law, the balance of currents that in equals out, is true but it's not an equation I have to solve in finding the currents, it's something I can discover at the end.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95lUJagN0A#t=904.11s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	OK. that's that point I hope at least discussed. So now we have the whole pattern here. Except that I really have still to justify the fact that it truly is A transpose, the transpose of that matrix, that comes into Kirchhoff's current law.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95lUJagN0A#t=1007.18s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And it's important in finite elements which as you know is just a terrific way to solve a whole lot of continuum problems. And what's it called when I have w and u together, both unknowns, not eliminating w now, it's called the mixed method.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95lUJagN0A#t=2648.71s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Minus A transpose C A is shown up there. So that's the saddle point. Saddle points are, when you have two-field problems, you're talking about saddle points, and the mixed method in finite elements is exactly that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95lUJagN0A#t=3233.16s
Rec 6 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	That means how many edges are coming in, and what number is that? Five. So I'll have five down the diagonal, and what else, what will be off the diagonal? Minus, a whole lot of minus ones, a minus one above and below for every edge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26JaJX8GMk#t=289.19s
Rec 6 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	For an orthogonal matrix. Let's imagine the matrix itself is real, otherwise I would just conjugate it. What's nice about that left side? What fact am I going to use about Q? Q transpose Q is the identity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26JaJX8GMk#t=2140.54s
Lec 18 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So I'm looking to see what multiplies-- I'm looking to make sense out of this. What's the first equation? Right, so the first equation or the zeroth equation, I guess. The zeroth equation, the one that'll run along and have this right-hand side, the zeroth equation is the equation when i is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B9aIlwEZcQ#t=1479.05s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	I don't know if you see what pattern we're getting here. Those were special rows, because that was only a half hat. These are typical rows. A typical hat function, that row is showing us five non-zeros, because it overlaps itself, the neighboring hats, and the neighboring bubbles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTM4v2gIeqk#t=944.68s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And of course it'll just be symmetric. You see the round hat? So that's the basis function, the trial function that has continuous slopes and heights, of course, and it has height one at that point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTM4v2gIeqk#t=2258.24s
Lec 35 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Because that's what we have to do. We have to undo the convolution, this unknown function is convolved with a known, K is known, some known kernel that tells us the point spread of the telescope or whatever we're doing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_lWzD2vigk#t=328.574s
Lec 35 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	These come from constant-coefficient, time-invariant, shift-invariant linear problems. LTI, linear time-invariant. And my lecture Wednesday, just before Thanksgiving, took a differential equation for u and found, and put it in this form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_lWzD2vigk#t=440.52s
Lec 35 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So now u hat, obviously I don't have to write all these, b hat 0 over c hat 0. Right? I just do a division. So on down to u hat 3 is b hat, is the third component of b, divided by the third component of c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_lWzD2vigk#t=1106.56s
Lec 35 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	OK, now don't forget here. That in going from here to here, I had to figure out what the c hats were, right? I had to do the Fourier matrix, or the inverse Fourier matrix to go from c to c hat, from b to b hat, so everything got Fourier transformed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_lWzD2vigk#t=1127.84s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So that's what makes it so good. OK. Homeworks, by the way, well, the first homework will simply be a way to get a grade list, a list of everybody taking the course.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgfkEUOFAj0#t=216.4s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So you're seeing, just this first day you're seeing some of the natural steps of linear algebra. Row reduction, multiply-- when you want to see what's happening, multiply both sides by C inverse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgfkEUOFAj0#t=2288.48s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And so here we'll see these guys clearly. Fixed and free, very important. But also let me say two more words, I never can resist. So fixed means the displacement is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgfkEUOFAj0#t=2892.91s
Lec 22 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	It's the one, it's the A transpose, right? This is what we're thinking of as A transpose w equal zero. Kirchhoff's current law, in equals out. How will I translate that in equal out for functions? Now I don't have-- On a graph, I just had the total flow, the net flow at every node.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SreJp2U0Vio#t=2741.75s
Lec 22 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So the only way out will be out through the boundary. And so I'll need to say how much flows out. This is the total source, the total in equal out inside.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SreJp2U0Vio#t=2888.19s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And what does that mean? A mechanism is a solution to Au=0. So that, a mechanism is a movement of the bar. So it's going to be non-zero. The bars are going to move a little.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBgPxmXeVM#t=1290.93s
Lec 7 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So the connection between pivots and determinants is just really close. Pivots are ratios of determinants, if you work it out. The second pivot, maybe I would call that d_2, is the ratio of a*c - b squared over a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR_pGtAWHpY#t=322.14s
Lec 7 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And then, of course, multiplying by x transpose, I'm still at zero. So the x's, the zero energy guys, this is straightforward, the zero energy guys, the ones where x transpose Kx is zero, will happen when Kx is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR_pGtAWHpY#t=1292.99s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And always there's some non-dimensional number. Here it's called the Peclet number. Actually, there's an accent on one of those e's, Péclet number. Which measures the ratio, the importance of convection relative to diffusion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZnCOIbesiA#t=147.43s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So we have to avoid this. So to avoid that assume A has -- this is the key word -- independent columns. Since this is a combination of the columns, independent columns means what? It means that the only combination of the columns to give zero is the zero combination.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZnCOIbesiA#t=2759.42s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	We don't know what the error is. What is reasonable to know about errors? We're doing a little statistics here. Somehow that error, that particular error of the experiment that we happen to run, and if we ran it again we'd get a different error, those errors come out of some sort of error population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZnCOIbesiA#t=2903.26s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Eigenvectors are the special vectors which come out in the same direction. Av comes out parallel to v. So this was not an eigenvector. Very few vectors are eigenvectors, they're very special.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5KiY9lvHc4#t=1386.49s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So here would be A to higher and higher powers goes to zero, the zero matrix. In other words, when I multiply, multiply, multiply by that matrix I get smaller and smaller and smaller matrices, zero in the limit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5KiY9lvHc4#t=1988.94s
Rec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And this term is V times some centered difference. I don't know whether I should use C. We called C, earlier in the book, C was a circulant. This is a centered first difference over delta x equal right-hand side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmTX1AeVAg#t=84.18s
Rec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	It's a matrix where even this spring has a two by two piece. So what's the problem with the free-free matrix? The free-free matrices, those with no supports, those matrices will be singular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmTX1AeVAg#t=1183.2s
Rec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Let's just think ahead here. What are the rigid motions, the null space of K, you could say, for a two-dimensional truss. So I've got a bunch of bars and springs. Think of a mattress.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmTX1AeVAg#t=1228.08s
Rec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	I'm in two dimensions, a mattress is a bunch of springs connected in a 2-D grid. And say it's free at both ends. So what can I do to a mattress? Oh, my gosh! I didn't expect that to be on videotape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmTX1AeVAg#t=1246.16s
Rec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Well I won't write all those words. That's a wonderful thing. It's a highlight of matrix theory except for the length of its name. So SVD is what everybody calls it. It's only like, every year now people appreciate more and more the importance of this SVD, this singular value decomposition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmTX1AeVAg#t=1534.5s
Rec 4 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The linear ones are the model problems that we can solve. This is how linear equations really come. Euler thought of, let's give Euler credit here, so forward Euler and backward Euler.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmTX1AeVAg#t=2372.06s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	We're speaking here about small displacements, small stretching up to the point where Hooke's Law continues to hold. And now what does Hooke's Law say? It says that each force in the spring is proportional to the stretching of the spring.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN7zitwRq58#t=461.53s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Gravity is the external force that's making things happen. We need a force term from outside to move us away from zeroes. And that will be the downward forces f_1, f_2, f_3 on the three masses.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN7zitwRq58#t=561.73s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	I guess what I want to say is I really have found that this way of describing, modeling the problem is successful for so many applications. You have somehow a geometry, a step which'll involve a matrix A. Then you have a physical step which involves a matrix C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN7zitwRq58#t=617.32s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	This would be correct. So this is an especially nice kind of problem. It's called statically determinate. It means I can determine the three w's from the three f's. I can go backwards.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN7zitwRq58#t=2034.28s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And this is named after Lagrange. So this is called Lagrange interpolation, fitting a polynomial. And if the degree is small, and maybe degree five would be okay, then that's an important thing to be able to do.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siqu0aOOQCM#t=1179.59s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And then the homework asked you to actually do it with values of a particular function. And see how close does the cubic spline come to the given function. OK, so what's a cubic spline? What does that word, spline, what should that mean in your mind? So a cubic spline is a cubic in each piece.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siqu0aOOQCM#t=1311.06s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Actually a hat function is a linear spline. A hat function is that low level spline that's linear between pieces. Now the B-spline is going to have the value one there. It's going to have no jump in the function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siqu0aOOQCM#t=1652.07s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	What does band-limited mean? Band-limited means that only frequencies in a certain range, say a range around zero, are included. So a band-limited function would be a function whose frequencies go from some value, say minus omega to omega, instead of going from minus infinity to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siqu0aOOQCM#t=2372.15s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	How many derivatives. Smoothness in the frequency domain is, how fast do the frequencies drop off. And here, band-limited means they drop like a shot. Band-limited means that the frequencies in the function, that these e^(i*K*x)'s are not there for high frequencies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siqu0aOOQCM#t=2450.9s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The transpose you would expect to be a row, a row vector. I should have the transpose of that there. And what is the transpose of that? Just tell me. Because we have an idea.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siqu0aOOQCM#t=2878.56s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So that frequency and this frequency, and all those others would be alias. Can I just write that word down, because you see it often. Alias. That means two frequencies, like pi and 2pi, and zero or whatever, that give you the same samples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0pZyXThRmM#t=541.07s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	How many have seen this word, band-limited? Quite a few but not half. OK. Band-limited means the band is a band of frequencies. So the function's band-limited when its transform, this tells me how much of each frequency there is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0pZyXThRmM#t=659.48s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Minus one was on this diagonal and that continued and zeroes was on this diagonal. So this is cyclic convolution, the circulant matrix, cyclic convolution by c, what's the c that produces that convolution matrix? It's just, it's got-- well there it is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ctngXQrmDc#t=2422.18s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	Do you see that we've seen that matrix before? And the cyclic convolution means you take its second differences, of course. We're taking second differences, but everything in our world is cyclic.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ctngXQrmDc#t=2481.03s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	So I tried to list here, so here I'm in Section 4.1, so I'm talking about Fourier series. So Fourier series is for functions that have period 2pi. It involves things like sin(x), like cos(x), like e^(ikx), all of those if I increase x by 2pi, I'm back where I started.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StnOg-q2tS8#t=164.55s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The condition number of K is the ratio of this guy to this one. In other words, two K, or a million K, or one millionth K, all have the same condition number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bciGyT6eeOE#t=1547.99s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	The relative error is the size of u, maybe I should put it this way. The relative error is the size of the error relative to the size of u. And I want to know how big that could be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bciGyT6eeOE#t=2350.41s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	We have x space, not time. So we're not starting from some thing and oscillating or growing or decaying in time. We have a fixed thing. Think of an elastic bar. An elastic bar fixed at both ends, maybe hanging by its own weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-agCn_nWztQ#t=74.39s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I, Fall 2008	And now here's one that actually is really important. A center difference. It's the average of the forward and back. If I take that plus that, the u(x)'s cancel and I'm left with, I'm centering it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-agCn_nWztQ#t=272.89s
Lecture 12: Lebesgue Integrable Functions, the Lebesgue Integral and the Dominated Convergence...	Then the following holds. The integral-- I mean, the absolute value of the integral is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute value. If f equals g almost everywhere, then-- so let me-- so let's just-- I have no idea what I was going to say.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pw1JWc9k4#t=949.64s
Lecture 12: Lebesgue Integrable Functions, the Lebesgue Integral and the Dominated Convergence...	So g plus or minus f sub n is always bigger than or equal to 0. I can now apply Fatou's lemma, which tells me that for a sequence of non-negative measurable functions, the integral of the liminf is less than or equal to the liminf of the integrals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pw1JWc9k4#t=2476.96s
Lecture 12: Lebesgue Integrable Functions, the Lebesgue Integral and the Dominated Convergence...	If f is continuous, both of these functions are continuous non-negative functions. And the Riemann integral of f plus minus f minus, which is f, the integral of f, is equal to the integral of f plus minus the integral of f minus, which is exactly how also Lesbesgue integrals are defined in terms of the integral, Lesbesgue integral of f is equal to the Lesbesgue integral of f plus minus Lesbesgue integral of f minus.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pw1JWc9k4#t=3052.86s
Lecture 12: Lebesgue Integrable Functions, the Lebesgue Integral and the Dominated Convergence...	All right, so that's the theory of Riemann integration. I mean-- Riemann integration? Lesbesgue integration. Next time, we will finish our discussion of-- measure an integration by introducing the big Lp spaces, which are spaces of measurable functions which have a finite-- which raised to a certain power, have a finite Lesbesguen rule, and show that those are Banach spaces that contain the continuous functions, of course, and in certain cases are-- the space of continuous functions are dense in these spaces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pw1JWc9k4#t=5042.15s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	So that concludes the general stuff about Banach spaces for now. And we're going to turn to Lebesgue measure and integration. Because so we've been talking about little lp spaces. These are spaces of sequences.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=1728.5s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	One is Lebesgue integration has much better convergence theorems. So you only have really one convergence theorem for Riemann integration, which is the uniform limit of Riemann integrable functions is Riemann integrable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=1804.08s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	L1-- and I'm going to put an R here. This is a set of all f from 0, 1 C such that f is Riemann integrable on 0, 1. Now in 18.100 and 100A, these are usually real-valued.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=1874.13s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	Simplest one is the set containing a single point. It has measure 0. Now I bet if you sit and think for a little bit, you can then prove that the outer measure of a set containing finitely many points, this is also 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=3565.62s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	And then, any number that's less than or equal to an arbitrarily small number has to be 0. For each n natural number, let I n be the interval that takes the form epsilon over 2n plus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=3748.19s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	I should write it this-- a sub n minus epsilon over 2n plus 1, a sub n plus epsilon over 2n plus 1. So I sub n is an open interval that contains a sub n for each n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=3780.55s
Lecture 6: The Double Dual and the Outer Measure of a Subset of Real Numbers	And as intuitive as that is, it takes just a little bit of work to show-- not too much, but just a little. And that will complete our construction of outer measure which is this set function which satisfies one through four but not three really.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWs93gASTJk#t=4801.17s
Lecture 18: The Adjoint of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK, so let's continue with our discussion of Hilbert spaces. And so last time, we finished with Riesz representation theorem, the only representation theory I remember, Riesz representation theorem, which states that if you have a Hilbert space, then for all f in the dual space-- which remember, this is a set of bounded linear maps from H to complex numbers-- there exists a unique v in H such that f of u is equal to u inner product v for all v, for all u and H.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctaYoR9tOY#t=0.0s
Lecture 18: The Adjoint of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	So now, A star is a linear operator. When I write A star here, I mean the map that takes v to A star v. So now I want to check that this linear operator is a bounded linear operator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctaYoR9tOY#t=839.24s
Lecture 18: The Adjoint of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	But now, the best theorem about that you should know or maybe heard at some point from linear algebra is the rank-nullity theorem, that says the dimension of the range plus the dimension of the null space equals the dimension of the-- let's say you're going from spaces with the same dimension, then the dimension of the range plus the dimension of the kernel-- I may be actually getting this wrong; it's the end of a day; it's the end of a long day-- equals the dimension of the whole space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctaYoR9tOY#t=2416.84s
Lecture 18: The Adjoint of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	So for example, the closed and bounded intervals a, b-- those are all compact sets. a, b, the set consisting of 1 over n, n a natural number, union the element 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctaYoR9tOY#t=2829.99s
Lecture 18: The Adjoint of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	And therefore, it always converges. So equismall tails means that somehow, that series converges, or the tail end of that series converges, uniformly with respect to this orthonormal subset. So in other words, for all epsilon positive, there exists a natural number N such that for all v in the set K, if I look at the tail, this is less than epsilon squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctaYoR9tOY#t=3552.77s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	Now, a natural question is, is that infimum, is that minimum, that minimal distance actually achieved by some element in the subspace? Now, the answer is, in fact, yes. And it's, in fact, true for a larger class of subsets of Hilbert spaces than closed subspaces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=124.24s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	Now, we'll see, when we apply this theorem, how such C's pop up. One of them is, like I said a minute ago, that-- OK, I didn't exactly say it this way, but C being a vector plus a-- so C could be some fixed vector plus a subspace, meaning the set of all vectors of the form v plus w, where w is in some subspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=340.38s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	v is in C. Again, capital C is the set of all elements of the form little u plus something from capital W. So we've shown that if we have a sequence converging to an element in H, then that limit must be in the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=2019.82s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	It's the Riesz representation theorem. OK, so the only category theory I know is the Baire category theorem. The only representation theory I remember is the Riesz representation theorem, which tells us we can identify a Hilbert space, the dual of a Hilbert space with the Hilbert space itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=3449.18s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	But claim-- I'll just write does a job-- i.e. for all u in capital H, f of u is equal to u inner product with v. All right, to see that, let N be the null space of f, the set of all vectors that get sent to the number 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=3997.41s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	So by previous argument for when we showed that H can be written as W plus its orthogonal-- the direct sum of a closed linear subspace and its orthogonal complement. So by the previous argument from that proof, we can show that v0 is an element of the orthogonal complement of N, the set of all vectors that get sent to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=4126.41s
Lecture 17: Minimizers, Orthogonal Complements and the Riesz Representation Theorem	Maybe it was also referred to the adjoint in linear algebra on finite dimensions. And so this is way ahead. But hopefully, what you proved in linear algebra and finite dimensions was the spectral theorem, which that if you have a matrix that is equal to its adjoint-- more generally, that it's normal, that it commutes with this adjoint-- then-- and for finite dimensions, the adjoint of a matrix was switched the entries, switch i and j and take the complex conjugate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcI2_r51Eb8#t=4465.98s
Lecture 22: The Spectral Theorem for a Compact Self-Adjoint Operator	So we defined the resolvent set of A to be those complex numbers such that A minus lambda times the identity, which I just write is A minus lambda, is an invertible, bounded linear operator, meaning it is bijective and, which by the open mapping theorem, tells you that the inverse is also continuous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sfaHVFWBU8#t=38.55s
Lecture 22: The Spectral Theorem for a Compact Self-Adjoint Operator	And if we restrict our attention to Hermitian matrices, which are referred to as-- which are also referred to as self adjoint also in linear algebra, or symmetric if we're just looking at real vector spaces Rn then the eigenvalues are real.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sfaHVFWBU8#t=121.32s
Lecture 22: The Spectral Theorem for a Compact Self-Adjoint Operator	So let me make a little remark here. So first off, the fact that this space has to be finite dimensional we proved last time. We proved at the end of lecture, the last lecture, that for a compact self-adjoint operator, the null space, the eigenspace corresponding to a given nonzero eigenvalue, is finite dimensional.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sfaHVFWBU8#t=615.99s
Lecture 22: The Spectral Theorem for a Compact Self-Adjoint Operator	So that's the end of the proof. And now what we're going to do is we are going to keep going. So the end result will be that we can determine all of the eigenvalues via a certain maximum principle and build up a sequence of eigenvectors, normalized eigenvectors, which are pairwise orthogonal simply because they come from how they're built up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sfaHVFWBU8#t=2401.29s
Lecture 22: The Spectral Theorem for a Compact Self-Adjoint Operator	So previous-- or I should say j equals 1, that's the previous theorem. We found the largest eigenvalue, or the eigenvalue with-- an eigenvalue with the largest absolute value via this theorem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sfaHVFWBU8#t=3133.57s
Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions	So sums are defined as x plus or minus infinity equals plus or minus infinity for all x in r. So if I have two functions whose values could be in the extended real numbers and I have one is finite and the other is infinite, then I just, by convention, their sum is defined to be plus infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETmIxkbTm3I#t=829.72s
Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions	OK. And I mean I've been using something equals infinity already when we've been just discussing measure, the outer measure of something being equal to infinity. In what follows, we'll be having expressions where we allow something to equal infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETmIxkbTm3I#t=1023.19s
Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions	I can write alpha to infinity as the intersection over natural numbers n of alpha minus 1 over n infinity, which implies the great thing about taking inverse images is that they respect all operations you can do on set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETmIxkbTm3I#t=1424.09s
Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions	And since the set-- let's call it A, which is the set of all F such that this is a-- so you're also proving in the assignment this collection of sets, such that the inverse images are Lebesgue measurable, this is a sigma algebra containing-- since we've now proved that all open sets are in the set, this implies that the Borel sigma algebra, which is, again, the smallest sigma algebra containing all open sets, is a subset of this here, which is the statement of the theorem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETmIxkbTm3I#t=1910.44s
Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions	We have that f inverse of infinity, this is equal to the intersection overall n of f inverse, the inverse image of n to infinity. And if I'm assuming f is measurable, then each of these is a measurable set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETmIxkbTm3I#t=2082.909s
Lecture 9: Lebesgue Measurable Functions	Well, we would like them to be closed, undertaking linear combinations, and also products, because in the end, we'll have LP spaces, which is products of-- integrals of products of integral functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETmIxkbTm3I#t=2543.07s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	OK, so at the end of-- so at last lecture, we introduced the general Lebesgue integratable-- I mean the class of Lebesgue-integratable functions and the Lebesgue integral. And we proved that-- we proved the dominated convergence theorem, and one consequence of that was the fact that if I have a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval a, b, then the Lebesgue integral of that continuous function equals the Riemann integral of that continuous function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=64.591s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	So Lp of E is really a set of all equivalents-- is a set of equivalence classes of measurable functions with finite Lp norm where two equivalence classes are equal if and only if the representative from the first equivalent class equals the representative of the second equivalent class almost everywhere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=1063.86s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	OK. So Lp is the space of measurable functions with finite Lp norms. See? I'm Already not going to refer to it ever again as the space of equivalence classes. You should think of them as space functions, just with two elements equal if these functions equal each other almost everywhere pointwise on E.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=1766.46s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	Pre-Hilbert spaces, these are just norm spaces that come from an inner product. So make the following definition. A pre-Hilbert space H, this is a vector space. Typically over C, but you can also just take it over R, that's fine as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=3946.31s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	For all V, w, and-- I wrote capital V, I should have-- written H a minute ago. Now we're in Hilbert spaces, pre-Hilbert spaces. For all v and w, the inner product of v and w is equal to the complex conjugate of the inner product of w with v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=4076.58s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	And from there, we'll introduce Hilbert spaces which are those pre-Hilbert spaces with this norm that are actually complete. And really, for any kind of-- so for-- and we'll prove this at some point, there's really only two types of reasonable Hilbert spaces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=4888.45s
Lecture 13: Lp Space Theory	Or a little L2 which is these-- this set of sequences that have finite little L2 norm. This is basically the only other type of Hilbert space that there is, and I'll say what I mean by that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYR1fXW95zY#t=4941.65s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] CASEY RODRIGUEZ: All right, so today, we are going to prove the theorem that I mentioned last time, the Hahn-Banach theorem, which is a theorem about being able to extend a bounded linear functional on some subspace of a norm space to all of the norm space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=0.0s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	And this will, therefore, answer the question that we posed at the beginning of this topic, whether or not the dual, which is the space of all bounded linear functions on a norm space, is nontrivial for every norm space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=40.85s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	So Zorn's Lemma states that if every chain in a nonempty, partially ordered set E has an upper bound, then E has a maximal element. So a partially ordered set E-- that means the set E with a relation that's basically like a less than or equal to that satisfies three properties, so that it's like an extended less than or equal to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=76.78s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	And a chain is a subset of E so that any two elements in that subset can be compared. One is either bigger than or equal to the other. One is always bigger than or equal to the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=99.82s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	And so as a warmup, we're going to use Zorn's Lemma to prove a fact about vector spaces. So a Hamel basis-- and I think I went over this at the end of class last time-- of a vector space V, this is a linear independent set, H, such that every element of V is a finite linear combination of the elements from H. So for example, this set consisting of the vector 1, 0, and the vector 0, 1, this is a Hamel basis for R2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=159.33s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	Every element in R2 can be written as a finite linear combination of these guys. And the fact that finite-dimensional spaces have bases is something you discuss in linear algebra, but now we're in functional analysis, which is linear algebra in infinite dimensions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=194.58s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	And we're going to define an order on E. So E is the set of all subsets of V that are linearly independent. And we define partial order on E by inclusion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=293.18s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	And therefore, I conclude that the set H union v is linearly independent, a linearly independent subset of v. But then, H will be less than, meaning it is less than or equal to, but not equal to, which implies H is not maximum, which is a contradiction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=865.9s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	So this is a little imprecise, but I think you get my meaning. So this assumption let me denote by star, namely, that we have a subspace and we have a bounded linear functional on the subspace that satisfies this bound.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=1228.94s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	And here, M prime is defined to be the subset or the subspace M plus-- so this does not mean quotient space. We were using pluses for quotient spaces. But this is the subspace of V consisting of M plus elements of the form a constant times x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=1425.16s
Lecture 5: Zorn’s Lemma and the Hahn-Banach Theorem	So now, I'm talking about how we prove Hahn-Banach theorem. So we define as our partially ordered set would be the set of all continuous extensions of u. And then we would put a partial order on that, where one extension is bigger than or equal to another extension if that extension extends the smaller extension.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAjiDivJoQ#t=1611.8s
Lecture 10: Simple Functions	And then now here, for example-- so you should try and draw your own picture on not just go off mine because, again, mine is looking kind of rough already. But now I look at the function-- the set of X's where the function is between 2 and 3/2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXMCTAF6SEE#t=1593.4s
Lecture 10: Simple Functions	We're going to define it a little bit differently, which is what we're going to move on to now, which is the Lebesgue integral of a non-negative function. And then we will define the Lebesgue integral, or Lebesgue integrable functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXMCTAF6SEE#t=3492.155s
Lecture 10: Simple Functions	So that's why we start out with introducing or defining the Lebesgue integral of a non-negative function. So definition, if E is a measurable subset of R, we define L plus of E. This is a set of all extended real-value functions, non-negative real-value functions that are measurable .	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXMCTAF6SEE#t=3575.74s
Lecture 10: Simple Functions	And the Riemann integral is the area underneath the curve, which also agrees with the definition of the Lebesgue integral. So that, like I said, should maybe indicate that the Lebesgue integral reduces to the Riemann integral whenever we're integrating a Riemann integrable function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXMCTAF6SEE#t=4912.9s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	And the spectrum of A was the complement of the resolvent set within the set of complex numbers. And so the spectrum is supposed to be a generalization of, in finite dimensions, what were called the eigenvalues.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=70.18s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	And so we just-- recall we called lambda an element of the spectrum, an eigenvalue if there exists a u not equal to 0 such that A minus lambda applied to u is 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=96.94s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	So we'll show that if lambda equals s plus it with t not equal to 0, then lambda is in the resolvent set of A. Now, suppose lambda has this form. Then A minus lambda is equal to A minus s plus-- or minus, sorry, it, which I can write as A-tilde minus it with A-tilde, a bounded linear operator given by A minus s, which is also equal to the adjoint because s is a real number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=429.26s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	So I should have said t is not equal to 0 and s, t, real numbers. So A minus lambda I can write as A-tilde minus it, where A-tilde is A minus s, again, a self-adjoint operator, all right? So if I can do an argument for A-tilde and show that A-tilde minus it is bijective, then I can conclude A minus s minus it is bijective.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=489.71s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	Now, here's the picture. Here's a-minus. Here's a-plus. a-plus is the sup over all of these expressions where u has unit length. a-minus is the inf over all these expressions, where u has unit length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=2089.69s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	And you'll see that in the assignment. Or maybe I'll do it as an example. So now, we're moving on to spectral theory for compact self-adjoint operators, which is one of the most, again, complete things-- or class of operators we can say the most about when it comes to the spectrum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=2333.95s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	OK, so this is not so much a definition as just notation. If A is a bounded linear operator, I will denote E lambda to be the null space of A minus lambda-- in other words, the set of-- or the subspace of eigenvectors with eigenvalue lambda, which, again, is the set of u in H such that A minus lambda u equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=2507.43s
Lecture 21: The Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Operators and the Eigenspaces of Compact Self-Adjoint...	So lambda has to be a real number. All, right so that proves part 1, that the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator have to be real. And the eigenspaces, which is what I have just started calling the E lambdas, the eigenspace, have to be finite dimensional for a compact self-adjoint operator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Tw47okZJM#t=3151.958s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	We introduced maximal orthonormal sets, so a collection of vectors in a-- we could say a pre-Hilbert space, but let's say in a Hilbert space. So this is maximal if u in H and u, e lambda equals 0 for all lambda in the index implies that u equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=43.14s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	Now, we have a special name for countable maximal orthonormal subsets for a good reason as we'll see. So let H be a Hilbert space. An orthonormal basis of H is a countable maximal orthonormal subset-- I shouldn't say n and N again-- of H. So an orthonormal basis is just a special name that we give to those maximal orthonormal subsets which are countable, meaning they can be either finite or countably infinite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=232.59s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	Now, why do we call-- why do we call a countable orthonormal-- or a countable maximal orthonormal subset an all orthonormal basis? So a basis is supposed to be something where you can write every vector in the space as some sort of linear combination of the elements of the basis, right? Now, we dealt with Hamel basis-- or bases, which are you can write every element as a finite linear combination of the elements in this subset.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=334.63s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	Now, let me just tie one thing up. So we know that every separable Hilbert space does have an orthonormal basis, a countable maximal orthonormal subset. And so if H is separable, that implies H has an orthonormal basis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=1131.85s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	Now, the rational numbers-- I should say-- there, now that's correct. Now, any complex number here can be approximated by a rational number here plus i times the rational number here. This is still in one to one correspondence with q squared, the Cartesian product of with itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=1429.0s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	I say infinite. That's only if the orthonormal basis is countably infinite. If it was finite, then that's actually not an infinite sum. It's a finite sum. Now, what follows from that is that-- so we have Bessel's inequality, which says that the sum of squares of the coefficients appearing in this Fourier-Bessel series is always less than or equal to the norm of u squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=1562.19s
Lecture 15: Orthonormal Bases and Fourier Series	OK, and we also associate to function f a formal object. The Fourier series of f is the formal series, because we are not making any claims about its convergence at all, summed from n in z f-hat of n e to the inx.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb69dAq4uh8#t=2865.292s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	PROFESSOR: So last time we introduced pre-Hilbert spaces as vector spaces that come equipped with a Hermitian inner product. Our Hermitian inner product is linear. So it's a pairing between two elements that gives you a complex number that's linear in the first entry.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=18.7s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	So let me first give the examples, basic examples of Hilbert space. So for example Cn which is a set of N-tuples. How do I denote this? Complex numbers where the inner product of two vectors, z and w, is equal to sum j equals 1 to the n, zj, wj.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=1066.14s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	If h is a pre-Hilbert space, a subset, which I'll denote by a lambda, lambda, and capital lambda, so just some subset indexed by some indexing set capital lambda. We say this set is orthonormal if for all lambda each one of these vectors in the subset has unit length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=1873.84s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	Or this is a 1. This is also an example of an orthonormal subset of c3, let's say, using notation from before. If I denote by e sub n, this is the sequence consisting of zeros up until I hit the end spot and then 0 afterwards and entry, which is an element of little l2, then this is an orthonormal subset of l2, OK.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=2057.86s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	OK, they're not dense in l infinity. So as long as you stay away from that, they're dense, OK. So continuous functions are dense in lp. Now, what's one way to approximate a continuous function? Going back to your introductory analysis class, hopefully you covered what's called the Weierstrauss approximation theorem, which says that for every continuous function, you can approximate it uniformly on the interval by a polynomial, OK.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=2453.01s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	All right, now the little lp spaces are also separable because except for L infinity also, which is not separable-- because, first off, a dense subset of the, let's say, little l2-- let's make things definite-- is the subspace consisting of all sequences, which terminate after some entry.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=2553.46s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	OK. OK. So orthonormal subsets we can define as a collection of vectors that have unit length and are mutually orthogonal to each other. Now just orthonormal subsets-- just any old orthonormal subset is not really the most useful thing, if we're trying to study the entire Hilbert's, or pre-Hilbert space h, because we may miss something if we leave out certain orthonromal vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=3235.11s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	But a more useful type orthonormal set is a maximal orthonormal set, which is defined as follows, an orthonormal subset e lambda, lambda and capital lambda of a pre-Hilbert space H is maximal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=3329.51s
Lecture 14: Basic Hilbert Space Theory	OK. So you know what countable means? Dense, remember, means that for any element in h there exists an element from this sequence, or from this collection, that's within epsilon of that vector from H.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdgFFf54U0#t=3895.64s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So let's get started. Last time, at the end of the last lecture, we introduced outer measure. So we first discussed what we wanted to measure, the properties of kind of a notion measure of subsets of to satisfy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=0.0s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	We wanted it to, first off, be defined for all subsets. We then wanted the measure of an interval to be the length of the interval. We also wanted the measure of a union of disjoint subsets to be the sum of the measures, and said we wanted it to be translation invariant, meaning if I take a set and I shift it by a fixed amount, then the measure of the shifted set is the same as the measure of the original set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=37.24s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	If it's an infinite interval, then the length is infinite. So the most involved part, or at least the crux of proving this, is doing the simplest kind of interval, which is a closed and bounded interval, a, b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=218.47s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	And if I don't write n equals 1 to infinity, it should be understood that n is always going from 1 to infinity. Let I n be a collection of open intervals such that this interval I, a, b, is contained in the union.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=458.91s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	And you should know that the union of open sets, any collection of open sets, is, again, an open set. So this is open. A is contained in O because A is contained in the union.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=1752.6s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	And then our measure will be defined on this sigma algebra of sets. When you go on to general measure theory, that is the input for you. A measure space will then be a collection, a sigma algebra of subsets of a set, with a measure on it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=3832.37s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	So these are sigma algebras. What's a non-stupid one? Let's say we take A to be the set, the collection of all subsets E, such that either E is countable or E complement is countable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=3949.66s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	It's usually referred to as the co-countable sigma algebra. And one can define a measure on this collection, this sigma algebra. But we're only interested in Lebesgue measure, which is going to be defined on, as we'll see, the sigma algebra of measurable subsets of R, Lebesgue measurable subsets of R.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=4207.68s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	Let capital sigma be the collection of all sigma algebras containing all open sets. So let's unwind this definition for a minute. So you are in this collection of sigma algebras if you are a sigma algebra and you contain all open subsets of R. So for example, the power set of R, which is a sigma algebra-- a trivial one-- contains every subset of R, so it certainly contains every open subset of R. This is in this collection of sigma algebras.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=4288.31s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	Then B is-- I'm going to say a lot in these next few words-- is the smallest sigma algebra containing all open subsets of R. And we call it the Borel sigma algebra.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=4402.27s
Lecture 7: Sigma Algebras	So how do you think of this? You take every sigma algebra in the universe that contain every open set. You take the intersection of all these sigma algebras. My claim is that you get a sigma algebra, and this is the smallest sigma algebra containing all open subsets of R.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHiu2F18dFA#t=4448.71s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	And so V as a vector space has these two operations satisfying a certain set of axioms. And so for example-- familiar old examples-- R2, Rn, and then, of course, C, the set of n tuples of R or C. But here's another simple example-- C 0, 1, which I'll remind you this notation here means the set of functions from 0, 1 into-- let's say their complex value, just to fix a field of scalars to work with, such that f is continuous, meaning it's continuous at every point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=458.11s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	This property here is referred to as definiteness. Definite-- I don't know if I'm spelling that right, but definiteness. And then the third property is that it satisfies the triangle inequality. This is that for all V1, V2 in V, the norm of V1 plus V2, this is less than or equal to the norm of V1 plus V2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=1098.89s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	And any vector space that has a norm on it we call a norm space. With norm is what we call a norm space. And this thing here, I usually-- so it's referred to as a triangle inequality.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=1138.89s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	All right, so a vector space with a function on it that satisfies these three properties we call a norm space. And then so like I said in my past classes, whenever I see a-- or whenever you see a decent definition or something with substance, you should do examples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=1166.22s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	So let me just write 3 implies c essentially immediately, all right? OK, so when we have a norm, we get a notion of a metric, a notion of distance between two vectors in our vector space by just taking the length of the difference of them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=1526.88s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	That's not hard to show. So let me quickly draw you a quick picture of what the unit balls look like-- R2, say, with the different norms. So let me recall that if I have, in a metric space, a metric, then B x, r this is a set of all y in x so that the distance from x to y is less than or equal to r.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=1741.47s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	And then the l infinity norm is just the sup over . J So little lp stands for the space of sequences with finite lp norm. Or you could say their lp is summable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=2648.65s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	The Cauchy sequences always converge. And this is our next narrowing down of the spaces we're interested in. And these have a special name, so so-called Banach spaces after Stefan Banach. So norm space, so a vector space with a norm, is a Banach space if is complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=2850.1s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	But R is complete. And in general, we give a name to those norm linear spaces-- those norm spaces such that this metric is complete. We call those Banach spaces. So examples which you saw, at least for the Euclidean norm and should be able to prove on your own, assuming the triangle inequality for the little lp norms, these are complete with respect to any of the little lp norms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=2976.64s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	And sometimes, those two come together or can be done at the same time. And you'll see what I mean. Let un be a Cauchy sequence in C infinity, in the space of bounded continuous functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=3220.67s
Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory	Little c0, which is the set of sequences in little l infinity-- so each element of c0 is a sequence, a bounded sequence such that limit j goes to infinity of aj equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoL4lQxfgwg#t=4298.55s
Lecture 19: Compact Subsets of a Hilbert Space and Finite-Rank Operators	And that will be a bounded sequence of complex numbers because we're assuming K is bounded, and therefore this sequence is bounded in K. So what we're going to end up having is entry by entry, a bounded sequence of complex numbers where these complex numbers represent the K-th entry of the sequence of vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBMyBVPRtKA#t=1064.06s
Lecture 19: Compact Subsets of a Hilbert Space and Finite-Rank Operators	So in particular, the kernel, the null space of T is the subspace that's orthogonal to the e1 up to eL, or at least includes that. Now from this we can conclude a nice property about finite rank operators, namely the first is that if T is a finite rank operator, then its adjoint is also a finite rank operator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBMyBVPRtKA#t=3595.76s
Lecture 19: Compact Subsets of a Hilbert Space and Finite-Rank Operators	And since we know how to solve finite-- equations involving finite rank operators, hopefully we know how to solve equations use with these operators as well. Is there a simple way we can characterize-- or not simple, but at least a more useful way to characterize them than just being the limit of finite rank operators? So the answer to this question is-- so I won't even write-- OK, I'll write answer-- is what are called compact operators, so the subspace of compact operators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBMyBVPRtKA#t=4625.51s
Lecture 19: Compact Subsets of a Hilbert Space and Finite-Rank Operators	So we're not going to prove this theorem, like I said, but just to see or do a sanity check that finite rank operators ought to be compact operators. Well, a finite rank operator, the image of this closed unit ball of a finite by a finite rank operator, that's going to be a bounded subset of a finite dimensional subspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBMyBVPRtKA#t=4927.39s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	So we say an operator, let's call it K, is a bounded linear operator, is a compact operator, if the image of the unit ball, taking the closure of that-- so this is just a set of all elements K u with u less than or equal to 1 closure is compact in H.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=61.74s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	I didn't give it once before, you did, but I'm not going to prove it. We'll just move on. And so another fact that you proved using this is that the set GL h, which is the set of bounded linear operators that are invertible, meaning it's bijective-- by the open mapping theorem, we know that if an operator is bijective, then it automatically has a bounded inverse, so I'll say bijective-- that this is an open set, is an open subset of what? Of the space of bounded linear operators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=2316.63s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	So the resolvent set is a set of all lambdas complex numbers so that A minus lambda is invertible. In other words, that you can always solve the equation A minus lambda u equals f for arbitrary f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=2724.96s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	So I'm giving you the simplest example possible. Then A minus lambda is equal to lambda 1 minus lambda 0, 0, lambda 2 minus lambda. And when is this matrix invertible? Precisely when lambda does not equal lambda 1 or lambda 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=2816.88s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	Then T has no, none, eigenvalues. So I'll probably put this example either on the homework or on the exam, but it has no eigenvalues. And you can compute that the spectrum, the set of all lambda so that T minus lambda is not invertible, equals 0, 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=3380.977s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	Now of course, you can phrase this, since the spectrum of A is the complement of the resolvent set of A, you could have phrased this theorem in terms of the resolvent, which is that the resolvent set of A is open and the resolvent set of A contains the complement of this set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=3543.68s
Lecture 20: Compact Operators and the Spectrum of a Bounded Linear Operator on a Hilbert Space	And that's the end. Now, I keep bringing up quantum mechanics, but I am a researcher in quantum mechanics, but I'm not. But in quantum mechanics, the observables-- meaning the things that one would actually measure like position, momentum, center of mass, these types of things-- are modeled by self-adjoint operators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDMFbzCsH0#t=4254.02s
Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators	[SQUEAKING] [RUSTLING] [CLICKING] PROFESSOR: All right, so let's continue our discussion of Banach spaces. So let V be a norm space, meaning a vector space with a norm on it. And last time, a Banach space was defined to be a norm space such that the metric induced by this norm is complete-- all Cauchy sequences converge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vN4sO7FVU#t=0.0s
Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators	And let's assume it's continuous for f, a continuous function on 0, 1. We can define a new function from f, Tf of x, to be the integral from 0 to 1 of K of xy times f of y dy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vN4sO7FVU#t=1265.69s
Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators	The sum of two linear transformations is a linear transformation-- or linear operator. The scalar multiple of a linear operator is a linear operator. And then those two operations preserve continuity. So this is clearly a vector space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vN4sO7FVU#t=3028.53s
Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators	So let me finish with a definition. If V is a norm space, then we denote v-prime as the space of bounded linear operators from V to the space of scalars. This is referred to as the dual space of V.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vN4sO7FVU#t=4868.16s
Lecture 11: The Lebesgue Integral of a Nonnegative Function and Convergence Theorems	We had that for simple functions. How do we get that for general non-negative measurable functions? OK, so what I'm about to prove is not just a tool for proving that but is one of the big three convergence theorems that you find in Lebesgue measure in integration or Lebesgue integration, which is the following-- monotone convergence theorem, which is the following that if fn is a sequence of non-negative measurable functions such that f1 is less than or equal to f2 is less than or equal to f3 on E.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzCHjN3_3s#t=1141.19s
Lecture 11: The Lebesgue Integral of a Nonnegative Function and Convergence Theorems	So here's that little bit of room I was referring to. Let epsilon be a small number between 0 and 1. And let En be the set of all x's and E such that fn of x is greater than or equal to 1 minus epsilon f of x-- I mean, phi of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzCHjN3_3s#t=1647.52s
Lecture 11: The Lebesgue Integral of a Nonnegative Function and Convergence Theorems	So let's let fn to be the set of all x's and E such that f of x is bigger than 1 over n. And let's let f be the set of all x's such that f of x is bigger than 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzCHjN3_3s#t=3249.09s
Lecture 11: The Lebesgue Integral of a Nonnegative Function and Convergence Theorems	So we have Fatou's lemma, stated as a theorem, of course which states that if fn is a sequence in L plus of E, then the integral of E of the liminf is the integral that's infinity of fn of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzCHjN3_3s#t=3917.74s
Lecture 11: The Lebesgue Integral of a Nonnegative Function and Convergence Theorems	So the norm of f being, let's say, the integral of the absolute value of f is a norm space, but it's not a Banach space. Or you could change the integral of the absolute value of f to what's called a big Lp-norm, the integral of f raised to the p all raised to the 1 over p.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzCHjN3_3s#t=4751.16s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	So in some sense, a measurable set is one that divides sets nicely with respect to outer measure. And we denoted script M to be the set of all E such that E is Lebesgue measurable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=100.69s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	So we gave this as an example of a sigma algebra. This is the smallest sigma algebra containing all open sets. So any other sigma algebra that contains all open sets contains the sigma algebra B, the Borel sigma algebra.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=210.78s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	Now, remember what we proved about outer measure-- that the sum of the outer measures is bigger than or equal to the outer measure of the union. So this thing is bigger than or equal to the outer measure of the union over all N A intersect E n plus A intersect E complement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=1864.96s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	So remember, the Borel sigma algebra is the smallest sigma algebra that contains all open sets. If I have any other sigma algebra containing open sets, that contains all open sets, then it must contain the Borel sigma algebra because the Borel sigma algebra is the smallest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=2123.83s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	So we've shown that these open intervals from A to infinity are measurable. It's now not a long trip to saying that every open set is Lebesgue measurable. So theorem-- every open set is Lebesgue measurable, and thus, a Borel sigma algebra, which is the smallest sigma algebra containing all open sets, is contained in the sigma algebra of measurable sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=2722.05s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	That will be in the assignment, so let me state it here. So what you'll prove in the assignment is if E is a measurable set and x is in R, then the shift of the set x E plus x, which is the set of all y plus x such that y is in E, is measurable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=3846.41s
Lecture 8: Lebesgue Measurable Subsets and Measure	So Lebesgue measure, which is just outer measure restricted to the class of measurable subsets, which is a sigma algebra, satisfies the three major things we wanted of a measure. Unfortunately, the measure is not defined on all subsets, but it's defined on a large class of-- a very rich class of subsets of real numbers because it contains open sets, closed sets, and like I said, sigma algebras are closed under taking countable intersections and complements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqdUuREzGuo#t=3905.99s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	"Or another way of saying it, at least one of these C k's contains an open ball. So now, what we're going to prove as a consequence of the Baire category theorem is so-called ""open mapping theorem,"" which says that surjective linear, bounded linear operators send open sets to open sets."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=111.76s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	So now, the image is in B2, an open ball in B2 centered at 0. So T of the open ball could be some of weird set, and we know that linear maps take 0 to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=324.8s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	Now, if I take this set and now multiply it by 1 over n0, I just get the rescaled guy, which is, to use a fancy word, homeomorphic to n0 times the image of the open ball.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=569.4s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	So from the open mapping theorem-- I don't know, it seems almost topological-- but we get what's called the closed graph theorem, which gives you sufficient conditions to be able to check if something is continuous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=2140.89s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	So a bounded linear operator is a linear operator which is continuous. So maybe it's difficult to prove the bound. So you have to go back and try and prove-- just for a God-given or instructor-given operator-- then you try and go back and prove continuity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=2446.22s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	So this is the definition of a partial order. So to go with this, we say an upper bound of a set D contained in E is an element e in E such that for all d in capital D, d is less than or equal to e.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=3947.53s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	For example, your partial order could be on the power set of some set. And the partial order is inclusion, whether one subset is a contained in another. Then it satisfies these three properties, but there's sets that cannot be compared to each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=4169.029s
Lecture 4: The Open Mapping Theorem and the Closed Graph Theorem	Another way, which we're going to use at the beginning of next time, is to prove the following-- but first let me make a definition. A Hamel basis, H which is a subset-- not a subspace, but a subset-- of V, a vector space, is a linearly independent set such that every element of v is a finite linear combination of elements of H.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mAXHuoDSw#t=4333.47s
Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem	Then you obtain the sum of two elements in W which must be in W. So this is an equivalence relation. And so then we define the equivalence class of v. This is the set of all v-prime in V such that v-prime is related to v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5dEJReQ8#t=446.91s
Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem	But you could start off with a normed space, a closed subspace of that normed space, and obtain a new normed space on v-mod W, if w is a closed space, in similar fashion, where I define this norm this way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5dEJReQ8#t=1288.44s
Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem	So I should specify this is N as a natural number-- then at least one Cn contains an open ball B x, r. So recall this is a set of all y in M such that the distance from x to y is less than r.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5dEJReQ8#t=1517.94s
Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem	Let's now use this to prove some fundamental results of functional analysis. So the first result we'll prove is what's called the uniform boundedness theorem, which says that if you have a sequence of linear-- bounded linear operators on a Banach space, then pointwise boundedness implies uniform mindedness or uniform boundedness in the operator norm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5dEJReQ8#t=3038.84s
Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem	So just playing around, so let's define the subset of B to Ck. This is a set of all elements b in B such that the norm of B is less than or equal to 1 and sup n Tn of B is less than or equal to k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5dEJReQ8#t=3180.37s
Lecture 16: Fejer’s Theorem and Convergence of Fourier Series	But to prove this flavor of statements requires deeper harmonic analysis, harmonic analysis being the umbrella that Fourier analysis sits in, and requires a knowledge of, or at least working with certain operators, which are called singular integral operators, which were developed back in the last century, middle of the last century at the University of Chicago by my mathematical grandfather and great grandfather, which gives you some beautiful results about, again, convergence of Fourier series, but also some applications to PDEs, which were why they were originally created in the first place and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IxHMVf3jcA#t=4699.92s
Lecture 23: The Dirichlet Problem on an Interval	So you're given a force and you would like to compute the solution or show there exists a solution on the interval 0, 1 satisfying the equation. And we'll say a classical solution, meaning it's twice continuously differentiable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTg7040uSc0#t=139.48s
Lecture 23: The Dirichlet Problem on an Interval	So now that's an equation we know how to solve. We have the Fredholm alternative that says we can invert this operator if and only if this entire operator doesn't have a null space or doesn't have a non-trivial null space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTg7040uSc0#t=1934.11s
Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	We say that the line integral is path independent. And we also said that the vector field is conservative because of conservation of energy which tells you if you start at a point and you come back to the same point then you haven't gotten any work out of that force.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5TPjZrsp2k#t=92.0s
Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And we have another notion which is being conservative. It says that the line integral is zero along any closed curve. Actually, let me introduce a new piece of notation. To remind ourselves that we are doing it along a closed curve, very often we put just a circle for the integral to tell us this is a curve that closes on itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5TPjZrsp2k#t=2148.0s
Lec 21: Gradient fields and potential functions | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	If you want a fancy word, it measures the vorticity of a motion. It tells you how much twisting is taking place at a given point. For example, if I take a constant vector field where my fluid is just all moving in the same direction where this is just constants then, of course, the curl is zero. Because if you take the partials you get zero. And, indeed, that is not what you would call swirling.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5TPjZrsp2k#t=2530.0s
Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	And, if I slice it by the plane z equals one, then I will get the level curve, which is the point where f(x, y) = 1, and so, that's called a level curve of f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK3NEf13nPc#t=1135.0s
Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	So, in fact, if you have been talking about hiking on mountains, well, that's exactly what a topographical map is about. So, I need to zoom a bit. So, a topographic map, this one from the US geological survey shows you, basically, all the level curves of an altitude function on a piece of land.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK3NEf13nPc#t=1208.0s
Lec 8: Level curves; partial derivatives; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	It's missing the other variables. So, a function of several variables doesn't have the usual derivative. It has only partial derivatives for each variable. So, the partial derivative, the partial f partial x at (x0, y0) is defined to be the limit when I take a small change in x, delta x, of the change in f -- -- divided by delta x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK3NEf13nPc#t=2399.0s
Lec 14: Non-independent variables | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	But of course, how fast does theta depend to itself? The answer is one. So, that's pretty easy. Plus, then we have the partial derivative, formal partial derivative, of A with respect to little a times the rate of change of a in our situation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23xbkrpQuAo#t=2853.0s
Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	You will see it's pretty easy. So, just to remind you, a vector is a quantity that has both a direction and a magnitude of length. So -- So, concretely the way you draw a vector is by some arrow, like that, OK? And so, it has a length, and it's pointing in some direction. And, so, now, the way that we compute things with vectors, typically, as we introduce a coordinate system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxCxlsl_YwY#t=63.7s
Lec 20: Path independence and conservative fields | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, we said when we have a function of two variables, we have the gradient vector. Well, at the time, it was just a vector. But, that vector depended on x and y. So, in fact, it's a vector field. OK, so here's an interesting special case. Say that F, our vector field is actually the gradient of some function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7UCBjGsRTE#t=866.0s
Lec 20: Path independence and conservative fields | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	It's the one that makes it hurt when you stick your fingers into the socket. [LAUGHTER] Don't try it. OK, and so now, conservativeness means no energy can be extracted for free -- -- from the field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7UCBjGsRTE#t=2599.0s
Lec 20: Path independence and conservative fields | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, what that means, an exact differential, means that it can be put in the form df for some function, f, and just reformulating this thing, right, because I'm saying I can just put it in the form f sub x dx plus f sub y dy, which means my vector field was a gradient field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7UCBjGsRTE#t=2988.0s
Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, in particular, this approximation is called the tangent plane approximation because it tells us, in fact, it amounts to identifying the graph of the function with its tangent plane. It means that we assume that the function depends more or less linearly on x, y and z.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChiM2-MV-qM#t=202.0s
Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So if you want a cultural remark about what this is good for. A partial differential equation is an equation that involves the partial derivatives of a function. So you have some function that is unknown that depends on a bunch of variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChiM2-MV-qM#t=359.0s
Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And a partial differential equation is some relation between its partial derivatives. Let me see. These are equations involving the partial derivatives -- -- of an unknown function. Let me give you an example to see how that works. For example, the heat equation is one example of a partial differential equation. It is the equation -- Well, let me write for you the space version of it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChiM2-MV-qM#t=378.0s
Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Remember that we have introduced the notion of critical points of a function. A critical point is when all the partial derivatives are zero. And then there are various kinds of critical points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChiM2-MV-qM#t=702.0s
Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And that is a point where the first derivative is zero. That is a critical point. And we used the second derivative to see that this critical point is a local maximum. But then, when we are looking for the minimum of a function, well, it is not at a critical point. It is actually here at the boundary of the domain, you know, the range of values that we are going to consider. Here the minimum is at the boundary. And the maximum is at a critical point. Similarly, when you have a function of several variables, say of two variables, for example, then the minimum and the maximum will be achieved either at a critical point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChiM2-MV-qM#t=787.0s
Lec 15: Partial differential equations; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Now we are in the same situation. We have a function, let's say, f of x, y, z where variables x, y and z are not independent but are constrained by some relation of this form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChiM2-MV-qM#t=1403.0s
Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, to decide which one it is, we use the right-hand rule, which says if you extend your right hand in the direction of the vector A, then curve your fingers in the direction of B, then your thumb will go in the direction of the cross product. One thing I didn't quite get to say last time is that there are some funny manipulation rules.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdzkFrgRcA#t=176.0s
Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	That means we can actually think of a product ABX and multiply them in whichever order we want. We can start with BX or we can start with AB. So, now, BX means we apply the transformation B to X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdzkFrgRcA#t=1647.0s
Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Even if they both make sense, they are usually completely different things. The next thing I need to tell you about is something called the identity matrix. The identity matrix is the matrix that does nothing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdzkFrgRcA#t=1736.0s
Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	It's the inverse of the matrix A. So, we need to learn how to find the inverse of a matrix directly. The inverse of A, by definition, is a matrix M, with the property that if I multiply A by M, then I get identity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdzkFrgRcA#t=2297.0s
Lec 11: Differentials; chain rule | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	These are the basic rules. And this is known as the chain rule. It is one instance of a chain rule, which tells you when you have a function that depends on something, and that something in turn depends on something else, how to find the rate of change of a function on the new variable in terms of the derivatives of a function and also the dependence between the various variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZVshlT33Q#t=687.0s
Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, if you remember last time, we looked at parametric equations -- -- as a way of describing the motion of a point that moves in the plane or in space as a function of time of your favorite parameter that will tell you how far the motion has progressed. And, I think we did it in detail the example of the cycloid, which is the curve traced by a point on a wheel that's rolling on a flat surface. So, we have this example where we have this wheel that's rolling on the x-axis, and we have this point on the wheel.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D4BbCa4gHo#t=23.0s
Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	dr/ds means position vector r means you have the origin, which is somewhere out there, and the vector r is here. So, dr/ds means we move by a small amount, delta s along the trajectory a certain distance delta s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D4BbCa4gHo#t=1477.0s
Lec 6: Velocity, acceleration; Kepler's second law | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, if you just look at the position vector, and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time, then together, they determine some plane. And, that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D4BbCa4gHo#t=2560.0s
Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	Remember, these approximation formulas, they are linear approximations. They mean that we replace the function, actually, by some closest linear formula that will be nearby. And so, in particular, if we set this equal to zero instead of approximately zero, it means we'll actually be moving on the tangent plane to the level set. If you want strict equalities in approximations means that we replace the function by its tangent approximation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XraaWefBd8#t=1653.0s
Lec 12: Gradient; directional derivative; tangent plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	That means u is actually in the direction of the gradient. OK, so that's a new way to think about the direction of a gradient. The gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XraaWefBd8#t=2733.0s
Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Today we are going to see how to use what we saw last time about partial derivatives to handle minimization or maximization problems involving functions of several variables. Remember last time we said that when we have a function, say, of two variables, x and y, then we have actually two different derivatives, partial f, partial x, also called f sub x, the derivative with respect to x keeping y constant. And we have partial f, partial y, also called f sub y, where we vary y and we keep x as a constant. And now, one thing I didn't have time to tell you about but hopefully you thought about in recitation yesterday, is the approximation formula that tells you what happens if you vary both x and y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYe98CcxPbs#t=23.0s
Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	That critical point is obviously a minimum. And, of course, it could be a local minimum because it could be that if you have a more complicated function there is indeed a minimum here, but then elsewhere the function drops to a lower value. We call that just a local minimum to say that it is a minimum if you stick two values that are close enough to that point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYe98CcxPbs#t=1192.0s
Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	You have this mountain pass where the ground is horizontal. But, depending on which direction you go, you go up or down. So, we say that a point is a saddle point if it is neither a minimum or a maximum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYe98CcxPbs#t=1261.0s
Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Best will mean that we minimize some function of a and b that measures the total errors that we are making when we are choosing this line compared to the experimental data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYe98CcxPbs#t=1946.0s
Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, you're left with two thirds. OK, so, that's the integral. The outer integral is the integral from zero to one of two thirds of one minus x^2 to the three halves dx.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_B0AapU0c#t=2111.0s
Lec 10: Second derivative test; boundaries & infinity | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, so a critical point functions, we have two values, x and y. That's a point where the partial derivatives are both zero. And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points. There's local minima.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_goGnJm5sA#t=50.0s
Lec 31: Stokes' theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Well, it turns out we can do the same thing in space and that is called Stokes' theorem. What does Stokes' theorem say? It says that the work done by a vector field along a closed curve can be replaced by a double integral of curl F.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzoYhe3H5dM#t=430.24s
Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	That was the region where x squared plus y squared is less than one and x and y are positive, of one minus x squared minus y squared dA. Well, hopefully, I kind of convinced you that we can do it using enough trig and substitutions and so on, but it is not very pleasant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60e4hdCi1D4#t=149.0s
Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Well, its mass is the sum of the masses of every single little piece. You would get that by integrating the density. The density for a flat object would be the mass per unit area. So, you can get the mass of a flat object with density. Let's use delta for density, which is the mass per unit area.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60e4hdCi1D4#t=1065.0s
Lec 17: Double integrals in polar coords; applications | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	The weighted average is the sum of the values, but each weighted by a certain coefficient. And then you will divide by the sum of the weight. It is a bit the same idea as when we replace area by some mass that tells you how important a given piece.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60e4hdCi1D4#t=1353.0s
Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Once we have this remark, we don't need to compute these line integrals anymore. We can just use the fundamental theorem. If we know this fundamental theorem -- -- for line integrals, that tells us that the line integral of a gradient field is equal to the value of the potential at the final point minus the value of the potential at the starting point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seO7-TwXH_I#t=941.0s
Lec 30: Line integrals in space, curl, exactness... | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Remember we introduced the dell operator. That was this symbolic vector operator in which the components are the partial derivative operators. We have seen that if you apply this to a scalar function then that will give you the gradient. And we have seen that if you do the dot product between dell and a vector field, maybe I should give it components P, Q and R, you will get partial P over partial x plus partial Q over partial y plus partial R over partial z, which is the divergence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seO7-TwXH_I#t=2610.0s
Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	The gravitational force is actually the gravitational field times the mass. I mean you can forget delta m if you don't like it. And let's say that the position vector, which should be aiming for the origin, R is here. And now let's say that maybe this guy is at the end of some arm or some metal thing and I want to hold it in place. The force is going to exert a torque relative to the origin that will try to measure how much I am trying to swing this guy around the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChhAS1sFvA#t=256.0s
Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	And if you remember the principle that the derivative of velocity, which is acceleration, is force divided by mass then the derivative of angular velocity should be angular acceleration which is related to the torque per unit mass. To just remind you, if I look at translation motions, say I am just looking at the point mass so there are no rotation effects then force divided by mass is acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChhAS1sFvA#t=333.0s
Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	And so what I am claiming is that for rotation effects we have a similar law, which maybe you have seen in 8.01. Well, it is one of the important things of solid mechanics, which is the torque of a force divided by the moment of inertia.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChhAS1sFvA#t=388.0s
Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	I am cheating a little bit here. If you can see how I am cheating then I am sure you know how to state it correctly. And if you don't see how I am cheating then let's just ignore the details. [LAUGHTER] Is angular acceleration. And angular acceleration is the derivative of angular velocity. If I think of curl as an operation, which from a velocity field gives the angular velocity of its rotation effects, then you see that the curl of an acceleration field gives the angular acceleration in the rotation part of the acceleration effects. And, therefore, the curl of a force field measures the torque per unit moment of inertia. It measures how much torque its force field exerts on a small test solid placed in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChhAS1sFvA#t=413.0s
Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	It is the electric charge density. It is the amount of electric charge per unit volume. What this tells you is that divergence of E is caused by the presence of electric charge. In particular, if you have an empty region of space or a region where nothing has electrical charge then E has divergence equal to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChhAS1sFvA#t=1026.0s
Lec 33: Topological considerations; Maxwell's equations | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	In particular, one application of that is if you want to study capacitors. Capacitors are these things that store energy by basically you have two plates, one that contains positive charge and a negative charge.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChhAS1sFvA#t=1178.0s
Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	So, what's the physical interpretation of a divergence field? So, I want to claim that the divergence of a vector field corresponds to what I'm going to call the source rate, which is somehow the amount of flux generated per unit volume.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8kXZSAp20#t=313.0s
Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	I'm going to do it first or what's called a vertically simple region. OK, so vertically simple means it will be something which I can setup an integral over the z variable first easily. So, it's something that has a bottom face, and a top face, and then some vertical sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8kXZSAp20#t=859.0s
Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	Diffusion is when you have a fluid in which you are introducing some substance, and you want to figure out how that thing is going to spread out, the technical term is diffuse, into the ambient fluid.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8kXZSAp20#t=1996.0s
Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	Well, you can imagine that obviously it will get diluted into there. And, that equation will tell you how exactly over time this thing is going to spread out and start filling the entire glass. So, what's the equation? Well, we need, first, to know what the unknown will be. So, it's a partial differential equation, OK? So the unknown is a function, and the equation will relate the partial derivatives of that function to each other. So, u, the unknown, will be the concentration at a given point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8kXZSAp20#t=2033.0s
Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	If I integrate the concentration of smoke, which means the amount of smoke per unit volume over d, I will get the total amount of smoke in d, except, well, let's see. This flux is counted positively if we go out of d. So, actually, it's minus the derivative. This is the amount of smoke that we are losing per unit time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8kXZSAp20#t=2690.0s
Lec 29: Divergence theorem (cont.): applications & proof | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 07	And, that's another way to think about what divergence means. The divergence, we said, is how much stuff is actually expanding, flowing out. That's how much we're losing. And so, now, if you combine this with that, you will get that du dt is minus divergence f, which is plus K del squared u. OK, so you combine this guy with that guy, and you get the diffusion equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8kXZSAp20#t=2983.0s
Lec 19: Vector fields and line integrals in the plane | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Well, what I have to do is cut my trajectory into these little pieces. And, for each of them, I have a vector along the trajectory. I have a force, I do the dot product and I sum them together. And, of course, to get the actual answer, I should actually cut into smaller and smaller pieces and sum all of the small contributions to work. So, in fact, it is going to be an integral. Along some trajectory, let's call C the trajectory for curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrypSZU8cBE#t=1159.0s
Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And this is the one point in the term when I can shine with my French accent and say Lagrange's name properly. OK. What are Lagrange multipliers about? Well, the goal is to minimize or maximize a function of several variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HVevXRsBA#t=52.39s
Lec 13: Lagrange multipliers | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	What does it mean? It means that our point q should be equidistant from all three sides. That is called the incenter. Q should be in the incenter. The next time you have to build a golden pyramid and don't want to go broke, well, you know where to put the top.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HVevXRsBA#t=2982.76s
Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	OK, so let's do a quick example. So, let's say that I give you C, the circle of radius one, centered at the point (2,0). So, it's out here. That's my curve, C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYdoS0tkAHA#t=450.0s
Lec 22: Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	But see, here, using geometry helps you to actually streamline the calculation. OK, any questions? Yes? OK, yes, let me just repeat the last part. So, I said we had to compute the double integral of x dA over this region here, which is a disk of radius one, centered at, this point is (2,0).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYdoS0tkAHA#t=823.0s
Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	That is a good way to think about it if you are thinking of a gas maybe that can expand to fill out more volume. If you thinking of water, well, water doesn't really shrink or expand. The fact that it is taking more and more space actually means that there is more and more water. The other way to think about it is divergence is the source rate, it is the amount of fluid that is being inserted into the system, that is being pumped into the system per unit time per unit area.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdoRiNSrqI#t=2911.0s
Lec 35: Final review (cont.) | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	That is Green for flux and that is the divergence theorem. Flux theorems. Here I say that will be divergence. And here it will be Green again. Green's theorem for flux says I have a closed curve that goes counterclockwise around some region.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24v9onS9Kcg#t=2727.0s
Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Let's take, so, it's a famous curve called a cycloid. A cycloid is something that you can actually see sometimes at night when people are biking If you have something that reflects light on the wheel.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57jzPlxf4fk#t=1575.93s
Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, let's -- And, we have a point, P, that's painted on the wheel. Initially, it's at the origin. But, of course, as time goes by, it moves on the wheel. P is a point on the rim of the wheel, and it starts at the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57jzPlxf4fk#t=1727.88s
Lec 5: Parametric equations for lines and curves | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So -- And, here's an example of where it actually comes in handy in real life. So, Taylor approximation says that if t is small, then the value of the function, f(t), is approximately equal to, well, our first guess, of course, would be f(0).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57jzPlxf4fk#t=2792.039s
Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	OK, so remember, we've seen Stokes theorem, which says if I have a closed curve bounding some surface, S, and I orient the curve and the surface compatible with each other, then I can compute the line integral along C along my curve in terms of, instead, surface integral for flux of a different vector field, namely, curl f dot n dS. OK, so that's the statement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7kCpzAuYw#t=23.0s
Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, let me first define for you when a simply connected region is. So, we say that a region in space is simply connected -- -- if every closed loop inside this region bounds some surface again inside this region.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7kCpzAuYw#t=167.0s
Lec 32: Stokes' theorem (cont.); review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Phi is the angle down from the z axis. So, it's zero, and the positive z axis, pi over two in the xy plane, and increases all the way to pi on the negative z axis. And, theta is the angle around the z axis. So, now, when we set up bounds here, it will look a lot like what you've done in polar coordinates in the plane because when you look at the inner bound down on rho, for a fixed phi and theta, that means you're shooting a straight ray from the origin in some direction in space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7kCpzAuYw#t=2024.0s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	But, in general, we've done more stuff with plane curves. With plane curves, certainly there's interesting things with all sorts of mechanical gadgets that we can study. OK, any other questions on that? No? OK, so let me move on a bit and point out that with parametric equations, we've looked also at things like velocity and acceleration. So, the velocity vector is the derivative of a position vector with respect to time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=616.85s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, it's not to be confused with speed, which is the magnitude of v. So, the velocity vector is going to be always tangent to the curve. And, its length will be the speed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=659.69s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, what's the length? Well, it's the speed. And, the speed is how much arc length on the curve I go per unit time, which is why I'm writing ds dt. That's another guy. That's another of these guys for the speed, OK? And, we've also learned about acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=731.94s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, it's the second derivative of a position vector. And, as an example of the kinds of manipulations we can do, in class we've seen Kepler's second law, which explains how if the acceleration is parallel to the position vector, then r cross v is going to be constant, which means that the motion will be in an plane, and you will sweep area at a constant rate. So now, that is not in itself a topic for the exam, but the kinds of methods of differentiating vector quantities, applying the product rule to take the derivative of a dot or cross product and so on are definitely fair game.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=767.23s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	OK, so the reason for that was that if you take any direction, you can measure the directional derivative, which means the rate of change of f in that direction. So, given a unit vector, u,  which represents some direction, so for example let's say I decide that I want to go in this direction, and I ask myself,  how quickly will f change if I start from here and I start moving towards that direction? Well, the answer seems to be, it will start to increase a bit, and maybe at some point later on something else will happen. But at first, it will increase.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=2034.18s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, critical points, remember, are the points where all the partial derivatives are zero. So, if you prefer, that's where the gradient vector is zero. And, we know how to decide using the second derivative test whether a critical point is going to be a local min, a local max, or a saddle point. Actually, we can't always quite decide because, remember, we look at the second partials, and we compute this quantity ac minus b squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=2253.739s
Lec 34: Final review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	So, for example, if you have a relation between x, y, and z, which are constrained to be a constant, then the notion of partial f partial x takes several meanings. So, just to remind you very quickly, there's the formal partial, partial f, partial x, which means x varies. Y and z are held constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwpwmGP5ITM#t=2526.849s
Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	OK, so, connected, there is a single piece. These two guys together are not connected. But, if I join them, then this is a connected region. We say it's simply connected -- -- if any closed curve in it, OK, so I need to gave a name to my region, let's say R, any closed curve in R, bounds, no, sorry. If the interior of any closed curve in R -- -- is also contained in R.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnPIqh7Frlw#t=707.0s
Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	And, maybe on the final it would be, there won't be any really, really complicated things probably, but you might need to be at least vaguely aware of this issue of things being simply connected. And by the way, I mean, this is also somehow the starting point of topology, which is the branch of math that studies the shapes of regions. So, in particular, you can try to distinguish domains in the plains by looking at whether they're simply connected or not, and what kinds of features they have in terms of how you can joint point what kinds of curves exist in them. And, since that's the branch of math in which I work, I thought I should tell you a bit about it. OK, so now back to reviewing for the exam. So, I'm going to basically list topics. And, if time permits, I will say a few things about problems from practice exam 3B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnPIqh7Frlw#t=1062.0s
Lec 24: Simply connected regions; review | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	You are integrating the function 1. You have to remember formulas for mass, for the average value of a function is the F bar, in particular x bar y bar, which is the center of mass, and the moment of inertia. OK, so the polar moment of inertia, which is moment of inertia about the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnPIqh7Frlw#t=1724.0s
Lec 28: Divergence theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Anyway, delta S versus delta A depends on how slanted things are. And let's try to make that more precise by looking at the angel that our plane makes with the horizontal direction. Let's call this angle alpha, the angle that our plane makes with the horizontal direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfEQabCGAqI#t=2066.0s
Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Vector dS is a vector which points perpendicular to the surface and whose length corresponds to the surface element. And the reason for having this shortcut notation, well, it is not only laziness like saving one n, but it is because this guy is very often easier to compute than it is to set up n and dS separately. Actually, if you remember in the plane, we have seen that vector n little ds can be written directly as dy, - dx.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phk05iSMezA#t=924.0s
Lec 27: Vector fields in 3D; surface integrals & flux | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007	Spherical coordinates are a way of describing points in space in terms of three variables. Here it is more like we are parameterizing the sphere. We are finding a parametric equation for the sphere using two variables phi and theta which happen to be part of the spherical coordinate system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phk05iSMezA#t=1681.0s
Lec 38 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Taylor's formula is the way you get from the representations that we're used to of functions, to a representation in the form of these coefficients. When I gave you the function e^x, it didn't look like a polynomial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOHrNt9ScYs#t=2395.28s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And that's a famous formula. We only need a little tiny bit of it, called the binomial theorem. So, the binomial theorem which is in your text and explained in an appendix, says that if you take the sum of two guys and you take them to the nth power, that of course is (x + delta x) multiplied by itself n times.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K1sB05pE0A#t=2748.43s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	here. So we've done Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 2, and now we're ready for Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 1. So now I still have it on the blackboard to remind you. It says that the integral of the derivative is the function, at least the difference between the values of the function at two places.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd2xP5zDsRw#t=1985.02s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So that's the solution to the problem. And now the thing that's interesting here is that we started from a polynomial. Or we started from a rational, a ratio of polynomials; that is, 1 / t or 1 / x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd2xP5zDsRw#t=2607.4s
Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So I thought I should review for you what the story with power series is. OK, could I have your attention please? So, power series is a way of writing a function as a sum of integral powers of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--lPz7VFnKI#t=116.86s
Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	This sum-- that sum converges to a finite value. And when x is bigger than R in absolute value, the sum diverges. This R is called the radius of convergence. So we'll see some examples of what the radius of convergence is in various powers series as well, and how you find it also.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--lPz7VFnKI#t=257.22s
Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So I drop that term out go up to the fifth term, the fifth power of x. Its derivative is now 1. We've gone through the pattern, we're back at +1 as the value of the iterated derivative, so now I get 1/5! x^5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--lPz7VFnKI#t=1014.4s
Lec 39 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Anyway, so we've got the sine function, a new function with its own power series. It's a way of computing sin(x). If you take enough terms you'll get a good evaluation of sin(x).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--lPz7VFnKI#t=1276.02s
Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	There's the easy case, and let's do that one first. The easy case is when at least one exponent is odd. That's the easy case. So, for example, suppose that I wanted to integrate, well, let's take the case m = 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv9kVDcj7yo#t=452.07s
Lec 27 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So what is theta in terms of y? Ah. So here the fearsome arcsine rears its head, right? Theta is the angle so that y = a sin(theta). So that means that theta is the arcsine, or sine inverse, of y/a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv9kVDcj7yo#t=2440.76s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	You did the positive integer powers in the first lecture, and then yesterday Professor Miller told you about the negative powers. So what we're going to do right now, today, is we're going to consider the exponents which are rational numbers, ratios of integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q_3FDOkVRQ#t=139.01s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	It's not. The definite integral is the area under the curve when it's above the curve, and it counts negatively when it's below the curve. So yesterday, my geometric interpretation was incomplete.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RLctDS2hUQ#t=1137.61s
Lec 19 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So that's e^b - e^0. Which is e^b - 1. The other one, you're supposed to be able to get by the rectangle law. This is one rectangle of base b and height 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RLctDS2hUQ#t=1996.12s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Because if I don't follow the scheme, I'm going to get a little mixed up. So the first part is to find the singularities. That is, the places where f is infinite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twzGBqPeW0M#t=1622.56s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And now I want to subdivide that into little chunks here. Now, the idea for adding up the area, the total area of this piece that's swept out, is to break it up into little slices whose areas are almost easy to calculate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGE3wb7H2PA#t=193.42s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy. Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law. Which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGE3wb7H2PA#t=1911.9s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	But I'm going to teach you one technique. Which fits in precisely with what we've been doing already. Which is differentials. The first and simplest kind of differential equation is the rate of change of x with respect to y is equal to some function f(x).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60VGKnYBpbg#t=103.84s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Partial fractions, remember, is a method for breaking up so-called rational functions. Which are ratios of polynomials. And it shows you that you can always integrate them. That's really the theme here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeXp1zC6Hls#t=53.31s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	A reduction formula is a case where we apply some rule and we figure out one of these integrals in terms of something else. Which is a little bit simpler. And eventually we'll get down to the end, but it may take us n steps from the beginning.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeXp1zC6Hls#t=1676.52s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And many more times as well. So let's just remind you, the second version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says the following. It says that the derivative of an integral gives you the function back again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JXPe2J069c#t=106.41s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	That is, we'll take, today we were talking about how integrals are formulas for functions. Or solutions to differential equations. We're going to go back and talk about integrals as being the answer to a question as opposed to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JXPe2J069c#t=1677.02s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So this point is of interest, not only because it's the place where it crosses the axis, but it's also what's called an inflection point. Inflection point, that's a point where because f'' at that place is equal to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRCN3daFCmU#t=3046.62s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	That's really what I need. The limit is x goes to one. The equation is still valid then. So I'm using the worst case, the case that looks like it's dividing by 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEqXhsIq_g#t=675.58s
Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And they're certainly as fundamental, if not more so, than trigonometric functions. So first of all, we'll start out with a number, a, which is positive, which is usually called a base.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v25gg2qJYE#t=55.11s
Lec 6 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Circular is a bad word in math. That means that one thing depends on another, and that depends on it, and maybe both are wrong. Circuitous means, we're going to be taking a roundabout route.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v25gg2qJYE#t=776.58s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Remember, that's our goal and we only have about a week left so we'd better get started. So first of all there is what I will call easy limits. So what's an easy limit? An easy limit is something like the limit as x goes to 4 of x plus 3 over x^2 + 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLdyDrBfvI#t=1121.6s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So this is going to be a theorem. Fortunately it's a very short theorem and has a very short proof. So the theorem goes under the name differentiable implies continuous. And what it says is the following: it says that if f is differentiable, in other words its-- the derivative exists at x_0, then f is continuous at x_0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLdyDrBfvI#t=2710.28s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And the average price is the total price divided by the total number of shares. And this is the discrete analog of this continuous averaging process here. The function f now, so I use w for weight, the function f now is the function whose values are 10, 20 and 30.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9a_NHXrBcg#t=1267.23s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	It's not constant on verticals. If we set things up with shells, as we did last time, to compute the volume of this, then T will vary along the shell. And we will still have an averaging problem, an integral problem along the vertical portion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9a_NHXrBcg#t=1570.84s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So we know that those are important points. So we're going to find the critical points. In other words, we take the derivative we set, the derivative of a with respect to x = 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN7k_bXXggY#t=250.43s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And when people ask you for the minimum point, they're also - so why is it that we call it the minimum point? We have this word, critical point, which is what x = 1/2 is in critical value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN7k_bXXggY#t=757.9s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And so I'm making those same distinctions here. But there's another notion of a minimum point, and this is an alternative if you like. The minimum point is the point (1/2, 1/32).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN7k_bXXggY#t=770.33s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	OK? So those are the two pieces of geometry that I need to see. And now notice what's happening upstairs on the picture here in the upper right. What I have is the angle theta is the angle between the horizontal and OP.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCPVBl953eY#t=2573.121s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And it's a formula. It says that the difference quotient, so this is the distance traveled divided by the time elapsed. That's the average speed, is equal to the infinitesimal speed for some time in between.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q37iOyBq44#t=1088.16s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	This is what the mean value theorem says. And here's the linear approximation. The linear approximation is saying that the average speed is approximately the initial speed, or possibly the final speed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q37iOyBq44#t=2378.69s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Which are themselves consequences of the mean value theorem. So these are the ones that I want to illustrate now. In my next discussion here. I'm just going to talk about inequalities. inequalities are relationships between functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q37iOyBq44#t=2664.36s
Lec 7: Exam 1 review | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And we'll be doing more of this in next the unit. So first of all, you'll be expected to be able to compute the tangent line. That's often fairly straightforward. And the second thing is to graph y' , the derivative of a function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJuAByQf5A#t=2618.76s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	The shell shape is a vertical shell which is itself already three-dimensional, and it has a thickness. So this is just a matter of terminology, though. This thickness is this dx, when we do this rotation here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpWQlKHPyJ4#t=2366.54s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	I just decided to divide the delta u by delta x and delta v by delta x. Good. Anything else? So we have the product rule here. The rule for differentiating a product of two functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sTKcvYMNxk#t=667.76s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	If you think of this -n as a unit, as a thing to itself, it occurs here in the exponent. It occurs here, and it occurs here. So how does that compare with the formula that we had up here? The derivative of a power of x is that power times x to one less than that power.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sTKcvYMNxk#t=1186.56s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	So it's good practice to introduce new letters when they're convenient, and this is one place where it's very convenient. So let's find a rule for differentiating a composition, a function that can be expressed by doing one function and then applying another function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sTKcvYMNxk#t=1450.59s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And maybe it's going down like this. And it's interpreting it geometrically. This would only work if f is positive. Then the convergent case is the case where the area is finite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0#t=542.51s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Whenever I make a discussion of limits, I say a finite limit, or in this case, it works for infinite limits. So in other words, when I say exists, I mean exists and is finite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0#t=879.69s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	The algebraic ones, the things in the process of getting to the limit, are the ugly ones. These are the easy ones, these are the hard ones. So in fact, infinity is basically easier than any finite number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0#t=1210.58s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	They're very worried about fat tails. That is, unlikely events that nevertheless happen sometimes. And they get burned fairly regularly with them. As they have recently, with the mortgage scandal. So, these things are pretty serious and they really are spending a lot of time on them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0#t=1509.87s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Is whether this area is fat or thin. I'll remind you of that. So here's the next idea. Something called limit comparison. Limit comparison is what you're going to use when, instead of being able actually to calculate the number, you don't yet know what the number is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0#t=1997.5s
Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	And so e^ - x^2 is less than this. So this is the reasoning involved. And so what we have here is two pieces. We have 2, the integral from 0 to 1, of e^ - x ^2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0#t=2600.15s
Lec 37 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007	Now and these are going to be improper integrals of the second kind. By second kind I mean that they have a singularity at a finite place. That would be something like this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_0QHbUnIA#t=41.56s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	And the thing that was my passion coming into MIT was origami. Here's a couple of pieces that I designed-- origami pieces, one square sheet of paper without cutting. Here's a lobster, and here's a copyrighted dinosaur from a particular movie of the year that I designed it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=92.5s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	Deployable structures where you might need to make folded structures-- transformable structures that can have different applications for different purposes-- need to reconfigure. The dream being that, we have these powerful devices in our pockets right now-- cell phones-- which are really powerful because we can reconfigure the bits in them to make software of all different kinds, right? There's an exponential number of different programs that we can write.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=187.64s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	So you should all take it. 006 should be a reasonable background. And in general, we're interested in two kinds of problems. One-- the big one is origami design, or in general, folding design, where you have some specifications of what you would like to build.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=323.63s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	It could be degree 4. It could be degree 3, as a T. It could be degree 2, either a turn or a straight. And you design little gadgets, little crease patterns, that fold into each of those little structures.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=623.3s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	Just pick out some cool DNA strands and design them in a clever way so they fit together to form a kind of square with dangling ends, which I'll call glues and each of those dangling ends can have a very particular pattern, and only identical or complementary patterns will attach to each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=873.27s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	You can also use it to build a replicator, where you're given an object like this that you don't know the shape of-- like, we don't know whether this exists, and we can't model it mathematically very well, and you stick it in a vat, and all of these tiles would attach and basically build a mold, and then start photocopying, in 3D, that mold.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=1033.99s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	It's like four cycles stacked up together with some connections between them. And it turns out, that's something you can solve with very fancy dynamic programming, like the stuff we've seen in this class, which focuses on just a single path or a single cycle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=1683.79s
21. Algorithms—Next Steps	There is an issue called gerrymandering, where your legislature draws the lines for what area on the map elects a member of Congress. And depending on how you draw the lines, you can engineer different results for who's likely to get elected.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nXw-f6NJ9s#t=3183.823s
16. Dynamic Programming, Part 2: LCS, LIS, Coins	Usually it's a couple of for loops. But this is a topological order in the subproblem DAG, which I defined somewhat informally last time. the. Vertices are subproblems, and I want to draw an edge from a smaller problem to a bigger problem, meaning that, if evaluating b in this relation calls a, then I'll draw an arrow from a to b, from the things I need to do first to the things I'll do later.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLBCUx1is2c#t=182.38s
12. Bellman-Ford	And so we assign those distances to be minus infinity. So that's what we're going to do today in Bellman-Ford. In particular, what we're going to do is compute our shortest path distances, the shortest path waits for every vertex in our graph, setting the ones that are not reachable to infinity, and the ones that are reachable through a negative weight cycle to minus infinity, and all other ones we're going to set to a finite weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9cVS_URPc0#t=164.74s
12. Bellman-Ford	If my shortest path distance from S to some vertex is finite, meaning it's not infinite or minus infinite-- some finite value, there exists a shortest path-- a shortest S to V path that is simple.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9cVS_URPc0#t=661.18s
11. Weighted Shortest Paths	Here's some of the problems that we've been solving. Single-source shortest paths, where distances are measured in number of edges in a path. And we used BFS to solve this problem, starting from a single source, usually a vertex s that we call.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF5Bgv59Sc#t=45.18s
11. Weighted Shortest Paths	In other contexts, in mathematics, you might have these be real numbers. But in this class, we're going to deal with integers. So each edge, if you have an edge, we're going to say this is the edge weight-- the weight of this edge e, from e.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF5Bgv59Sc#t=279.86s
11. Weighted Shortest Paths	But before we go on to showing you how to solve single-source shortest paths in a DAG using this algorithm that I'm calling DAG relaxation here, I'm going to go back to a thing that we talked about in breadth-first search, where in breadth-first search when we solved single-source shortest paths, we output two things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF5Bgv59Sc#t=1659.2s
11. Weighted Shortest Paths	So this is the idea. We start from an over-estimate, an upper bound on the distance estimate. And then we're repeatedly going to lower that value as we gain more information about the graph, maintaining that we're always upper-bounding the distance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF5Bgv59Sc#t=2319.82s
11. Weighted Shortest Paths	It's basically saying that if I have a vertex u, a vertex v, vertex x, for example, the shortest path distance-- the shortest path distance delta of u, v-- that's the shortest distance from u to v-- it can't be bigger then a shortest path from u to v that also goes through x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF5Bgv59Sc#t=2392.45s
11. Weighted Shortest Paths	I can't decrease my minimum distance. So this is the statement of the triangle inequality, that the shortest path distance from u to v can't be bigger than the shortest path distance from u to x plus the shortest path distance from x to v for any x in my graph that's not u and v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF5Bgv59Sc#t=2464.98s
Problem Session 8	I don't think I missed any here. OK, fabulous. So incidentally, continuing on-- AUDIENCE: What's k? JUSTIN SOLOMON: k-- k is the total amount of time that Tim the Beaver has allotted to do his job fair scavenging.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_A-ig1n8CM#t=1800.41s
2. Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays	And this is the analogous notion for data structures, where we want to maintain some data according to various operations. The same problem can be solved by many different data structures. And we're going to see that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHhwJjR0mZA#t=193.0s
2. Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays	So our model is that remember allocation model is that we can allocate a static array of size em but it's just a size n I can't just say please make it bigger by 1 I need I need space to store this extra element.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHhwJjR0mZA#t=1662.053s
2. Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays	They usually call this the tail-- head and tail. And if we always just store a pointer to the last list-- this is what we call data structure augmentation, where we add some extra information to the data structure and-- we have to keep it up to date all the time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHhwJjR0mZA#t=1983.15s
2. Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays	Amortized means a particular kind of averaging-- averaging over the sequence of operations. So while individual operations will be expensive, one near the end, when I have to resize the array, is going to take linear time just for that one operation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHhwJjR0mZA#t=2856.67s
Problem Session 5	And indeed, this problem is no exception to that. So in this problem, we're given an undirected graph. And as usual, we will call him G. And we define a particular number that we're trying to measure in this problem, right? So in particular, if we're given a vertex v, then we can define something called the eccentricity of v, which is the distance to the farthest-away thing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLdooNwP7Pw#t=103.84s
Problem Session 5	So one thing that I can do is say, OK. So remember that my radius is the min, the min over all u of epsilon of u. Then I'm going to define a vertex, u0, to be the arg min over u of epsilon of u.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLdooNwP7Pw#t=1248.98s
Problem Session 5	And that is equal to the distance from u to v now, because I just made all these definitions. And now I get to use my favorite inequality. In fact, this is sort of the only inequality we know in this class so far, I think, which is the triangle inequality, which says that, of course, this is less than or equal to the distance from u to u0 plus the distance from u0 to v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLdooNwP7Pw#t=1470.5s
Problem Session 5	If you're wondering, this is 12, or big O of 1 pairs of cities, meaning that, like-- for itinerary purposes-- itinerary-- meaning that if I always enter an airport in one of city A, B, C, or my hometown, and I always exit through another one, so then there's four possible cities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLdooNwP7Pw#t=3816.7s
Problem Session 5	I add together and compute the cost, the cost of that trip. And remember, cost in this case is equal to the minimum number of connections. And then I return the minimizer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLdooNwP7Pw#t=4069.93s
Problem Session 5	The left face is f1. And the front-facing face here, f2. Notice that we've identified these by like vectors that point 90 degrees out from the face. These are called normal vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLdooNwP7Pw#t=4271.36s
13. Dijkstra	By relaxing edges forward. By maintaining this invariant that we had shortest paths as we were processing these things in topological order. Then last time, we were talking about general graphs, graphs that could contain cycles, and this is our most general algorithm, because if there are negative weight cycles, Bellman-Ford, which we talked about last time, can detect them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSHizBK9JD8#t=139.88s
13. Dijkstra	Now this property, this idea wouldn't work necessarily in the context of negative edge weights. Here, we have this growing frontier, this ball around my source. And as I grow my thing, these things are at further and further distance, because any edge from something back here as I'm growing my ball a certain distance, these things are outside that distance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSHizBK9JD8#t=474.52s
13. Dijkstra	But in general, if I had a path going from s to some v, and it's going through some vertex u, I have some shortest path. This is the shortest path from s to v, and it goes through some point u, some vertex u.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSHizBK9JD8#t=545.62s
13. Dijkstra	But I'm going to cross-link it with a dictionary, a dictionary that maps IDs to their location in the priority queue. We've done this many times in the data structures section. We're trying to cross link to data structures to make a query on a different type of key to find its place in another data structure.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSHizBK9JD8#t=1658.64s
Quiz 1 review	Even though we've done it before, it should be very easy for you. Just say, I'm augmenting by my max. Max can be computed as the max between me and my left and right subtree if they exist.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e98MPnMHLxE#t=1664.595s
Quiz 1 review	So insertion sort maybe is not so great. But selection sort, the name of the game there is that if my reads are cheap but my writes are expensive, selection sort it actually does pretty well, because I only have-- sorry.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e98MPnMHLxE#t=2317.84s
Quiz 1 review	So the important thing here about correctness is that peak rainfall gives it to me and it gives it to me in the time bound that I'm looking for. And peak rainfall is returning the peak rainfall at a particular latitude since t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e98MPnMHLxE#t=4577.89s
3. Sets and Sorting	In any event, today, in our lecture, we're concerned with one particular interface, which is called a set. A set is exactly what it sounds like. It's a big pile of things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS9aPzUNG-s#t=192.66s
10. Depth-First Search	So we should probably start with that. So if you recall, graph is a collection of nodes or vertices depending-- I don't know, is it like a European American thing or something-- and edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfWDYSffUU#t=54.91s
10. Depth-First Search	Then we talked about the neighbors of a given vertex, which are the vertices that you can reach by following edges in or out of your vertex. So in particular, the outgoing neighbors, which we sort of implicitly defined in our previous lecture but didn't call it out, we're going to notate with Adj+.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfWDYSffUU#t=156.5s
10. Depth-First Search	There is a term that I think I forgot to define last time because it didn't really matter a ton, which is a simple path, which is just a path that doesn't have the same vertex more than once.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfWDYSffUU#t=258.339s
10. Depth-First Search	Breadth-first search is an algorithm. And the reason we use the word breadth is because it's kind of, remember, we talked about level sets last time because we talked about breadth-first search in the context of computing shortest paths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfWDYSffUU#t=364.16s
10. Depth-First Search	Well, what do I know about everything in its connected component? Well, it's reachable from that vertex. Remember, we just solved the reachability problem, which says, if I have a vertex, I can now tell you all the other vertices that are reachable from this guy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfWDYSffUU#t=1638.838s
10. Depth-First Search	So we need to prove this thing. So what are we going to do? Well, what do we need to check is the topological order is that if I look at any edge of my graph, it obeys the relationship that I have on the screen here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfWDYSffUU#t=2307.63s
Problem Session 3	Remember from lecture 2, we have a set interface, which is about querying items by their key and sort of intrinsic order that's about the items themselves, versus a sequence interface that we started out with, with linked lists and so on, and arrays, where we're given an order, and we want to maintain that order.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=61.085s
Problem Session 3	Linear expected time means I can rebuild the entire data structure every time I do an operation. So this is easy. OK, that's the first thing to realize. This is big. Great.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=325.27s
Problem Session 3	ERIK DEMAINE: Digimon. Wow, you guys are so young. Pokemon, the ancient form. Pokemon is short for pocket monsters. And in fact, in the original-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] ERIK DEMAINE: --anime-- AUDIENCE: Actually, there's [INAUDIBLE]..	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=1690.313s
Problem Session 3	But that is, together, radix sort on something, or Jason likes to call this tuple sorting. Tuple sort is the thing-- is the algorithm that says, sort by the last thing, then sort by the previous thing, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=2033.33s
Problem Session 3	It's integers in the range 0 to n squared. This, I can just solve with radix sort, because my radix sort, at this point, we've done it a third time. Radix sort, we can sort as long as the integers are bounded by a polynomial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=2332.61s
Problem Session 3	ERIK DEMAINE: Multiply by fi and fj, yeah. When I went-- I didn't go to school, but then we learned cross multiplication, which is the same as multiplying both sides by fi and multiplying both sides by fj, as you said.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=2549.62s
Problem Session 3	And then this does the floor at the appropriate time. But this is just operations on integers. And now these are integers representing how good my Pokemon are. They have the property that any two distinct ones-- before I take the floor, any two distinct ones are at least 1 apart.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=2990.192s
Problem Session 3	I've grown to like it. This is called spoonerism, where you replace some part of the beginning of your thing. OK, that's one joke. There's another joke in this problem. Anyway, they're building a new wing of the Stata Center, as one does.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=3214.97s
Problem Session 3	And it's not hard to do that. It's called a sliding window technique, where you compute it for the first k guys. And then you remove this item and add this item.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bXSXuLVb0#t=5059.41s
Problem Session 6	Oof, that's a tough one. The weighted radius is a measurement, which is associated not with a vertex, but rather with the graph. And it's equal to the min over all possible vertices, u, of the weighted eccentricity of u.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kshe8d8rxHo#t=817.41s
Problem Session 6	So overall, there's order kn edges in my graph, OK? Great. So now my problem is not so bad. I have a source, which is the place where our walker starts. I have t, which is the destination, where she wants to go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kshe8d8rxHo#t=3860.31s
Problem Session 6	I'm going to say edge weight to refer to the edge weight in my graph. And that's going to be equal to the cost of the edge. And only keep around-- but only for routes that can carry at least w star amount of weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kshe8d8rxHo#t=5000.04s
9. Breadth-First Search	So let's see an example of a graph that is not simple. So sorry, I haven't actually defined it. A simple graph is a graph that has no self loops, so it can't go from a vertex to itself, and every edge is distinct.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFVYVzlvk9c#t=617.11s
9. Breadth-First Search	In any event, there's one additional piece of terminology that matters quite a bit, which is degree. And this is nothing more than just counting the size of this set. So the out degree is the number of edges that point out of a vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFVYVzlvk9c#t=1048.069s
9. Breadth-First Search	So the basic idea of an adjacency list is that what I'm going to store is a set that maps a vertex u to everything adjacent to u. So in other words, I'm just going to keep track of all the outgoing edges from every vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFVYVzlvk9c#t=1383.75s
9. Breadth-First Search	You should be able to kind of follow the gradient back to the original vertex. OK, so in other words, I'm going to basically decorate my graph with one additional thing. We'll call it p of v which is the previous vertex on the shortest path from my source point to my vertex v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFVYVzlvk9c#t=2321.32s
Quiz 3 Review	And relate recursively, I-- usually what I want is an expression, a mathematical expression, relating the definition of a subproblem you had in the previous section, relating those, in math terms, to the other things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKFGdo4Sck#t=674.89s
Quiz 3 Review	And that's one way to look at dynamic programming. OK, so then as we were talking about topological order, arguing that relation is acyclic. Essentially, just defining what smaller means when we say we're recursing on smaller subproblems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKFGdo4Sck#t=827.93s
Quiz 3 Review	There are n plates of food on the menu, where each plate has a certain information, it has a volume, the number of calories in that dish. And a sweetness label, basically 0 or 1, whether it's sweet or not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKFGdo4Sck#t=4264.22s
Problem Session 4	It meant a property that I can compute only by looking at my children-- the augmentations of my children, recursively. So here, instead of trying to increment or try to think about, locally, what this augmentation should be, I'm going to throw away my old augmentation and just recompute it from my children, because those, recursively, had better be correct.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAyraVVYB64#t=1327.1s
Problem Session 4	Basically every data structure we've shown you takes space-- the order of the things that we're storing. It's not using additional space. It might take more time to do certain things, but the space takes the number of items that we're storing plus, maybe, a constant factor.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAyraVVYB64#t=2272.51s
Problem Session 4	And wanting to start on her team, some number of players that have the highest performance. And by performance, we mean the average number of points they've played in games that they have logged in their system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAyraVVYB64#t=4661.65s
1. Algorithms and Computation	This input goes to one, two-- I don't know. There's some kind of mapping here. These edges represent a binary relation, and it's kind of a graph, a bipartite graph between these inputs and outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-tUyM_y7s#t=288.49s
1. Algorithms and Computation	It takes inputs to outputs. An algorithm is some kind of function that takes these inputs, maps it to a single output, and that output better be correct based on our problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-tUyM_y7s#t=619.13s
1. Algorithms and Computation	And so what we're going to use to measure time or efficiency is something called asymptotic analysis. Anyone here understand what asymptotic analysis is? Probably, since it's in both of your prerequisites, I think-- but we will go through a formal definition of asymptotic notation in recitation tomorrow, and you'll get a lot of practice in comparing functions using an asymptotic analysis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-tUyM_y7s#t=1709.59s
1. Algorithms and Computation	In general, what we use in this class is a machine called a word RAM, which we use for its theoretical brevity. Word RAM is kind of a loaded term. What do these things mean? Does someone know what RAM means? STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] JASON KU: Random access memory-- it means that I can randomly access different places in memory in constant time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-tUyM_y7s#t=2241.12s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	Today we're going to start a new section on algorithmic design-- how to, from scratch, come up with a polynomial time algorithm to solve a problem. And in particular, we're going to talk about a algorithmic design paradigm called dynamic programming, which is extremely powerful.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=41.95s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	The edges are the dependencies between those subproblems. Then what we'd like is the topological ordering, the topological sort problem we talked about in the context of DFS or DAG shortest paths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=280.36s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	So we're going to maintain our good friend, the dictionary, which is abstract data type or interface. We could use different data structures to do it. But we're going to map some problems to their solutions, at least the ones that we've solved already.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=1001.92s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	So just to close the loop here, when I say dynamic programming, I mean recursion with memoization. I mean, we take-- we write a recursive piece of code, which is like def f of some args, some sub-problem specification.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=1633.05s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	If I gave you these deltas for free and I gave you these weights, which we know from our weight data structure, how long does it take to compute this min? Well, however many things there are, however many numbers we're minning, which is the size of the incoming adjacency list plus 1 for that infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=1954.71s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	And so if you compute this sum, sum of incoming edges to every vertex, that's all the edges. So this is v plus e. So in fact, this algorithm is morally the same algorithm as the one that we saw on the DAG shortest path lecture, which was compute a topological order and process vertices in that order and relax edges going out from vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=1974.43s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	In the relaxation algorithm, DAG relaxation, for each incoming edge to v, we update d of e if it's better. And so if you repeatedly update if you're better, that ends up computing a min.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=2028.49s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	We could do all the suffixes, x from i onward for all i. Or we could do substrings, which are the consecutive items from i to j. I don't write subsequence here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=2607.71s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	Subsequence means you can omit items in the middle. So substring you have to start in some position and do all the things up to j. So these are nice, easy to express in Python notation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=2624.48s
15. Dynamic Programming, Part 1: SRTBOT, Fib, DAGs, Bowling	What we're using is what we like to call local brute force, where when we think about pin i, we look at all of the possible things I could do to pin i, here there's really only three options of what I could do.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-cftqTcdI#t=3259.12s
4. Hashing	JASON KU: Welcome to the fourth lecture of 6.006. Today we are going to be talking about hashing. Last lecture, on Tuesday, Professor Solomon was talking about set data structures, storing things so that you can query items by their key right, by what they intrinsically are-- versus what Professor Demaine was talking about last week, which was sequence data structures, where we impose an external order on these items and we want you to maintain those.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8YGneFCWE#t=12.91s
4. Hashing	That's what we're going to try to prove. And the model of computation that's weaker than what we've been talking about previously is what I'm going to call the comparison model. And a comparison model means-- is that the items, the objects I'm storing-- I can kind of think of them as black boxes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8YGneFCWE#t=290.09s
4. Hashing	It's either true and I do some other computation, or it's false and I'll do a different set of computation. That makes sense? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you a comparison-- an algorithm in the comparison model as what I like to call a decision tree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8YGneFCWE#t=409.83s
4. Hashing	The user, when they're using this thing, doesn't know which a and b I picked, so it's really hard for them to give me a bad example. And this universal hash function-- this universal hash family, shall we say-- really, this is a family of functions, and I'm choosing one randomly within that family-- is universal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8YGneFCWE#t=2578.34s
4. Hashing	And universality says that-- what is the property of universality? It means that the probability, by choosing a hash function from this hash family, that a certain key collides with another key is less than or equal to 1/m for all-- any different two keys in my universe.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8YGneFCWE#t=2601.12s
8. Binary Heaps	It's very easy to find the max. Where is it? At the end. delete_max, the maximum element is always the last element in a increasing sorted array. I guess that's constant amortized, because then I have to delete it, which may incur resizing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnpo1atN-Iw#t=416.2s
8. Binary Heaps	So there are multiple types of heaps. This type of heap is called a binary heap. We will talk about others in future lectures. I'm going to call it Q. Explicit thing-- this is an array representing a complete binary tree, called the array Q. And we want every node to satisfy the so-called max-heap property, which says Q[i] is greater than or equal to Q[j] for both children left of i and right of i.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnpo1atN-Iw#t=1504.88s
14. APSP and Johnson	Today, we're going to be focusing on this new problem called all-pairs shortest paths. It's not really complicated. Instead of having a single source, we are essentially wanting to, given an input-- this is our weighted graph, where we've got a graph V, E, and we've got a weight function from the edges to the integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSmaW-ud6A#t=89.97s
14. APSP and Johnson	We have to do the same thing around each vertex. But it seems like a powerful transformation technique that maybe we can get this thing that we want, which is a G prime, a reweighting of the graph where all the edge weights are positive or non-negative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSmaW-ud6A#t=2328.67s
14. APSP and Johnson	OK, great. So that's basically it. That's the idea behind Johnson's algorithm. It's really a reduction problem or a reduction algorithm. We reducing from solving kind of signed all-pairs shortest paths, graphs where their weights could be positive or negative, and we're reducing to creating a graph that has the same shortest paths properties, but only has non-negative edge weights.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSmaW-ud6A#t=2813.7s
19. Complexity	This is the set of all problems solvable in polynomial time. We talked about what polynomial time means a bunch last lecture. So just recall that polynomial time means polynomial in the problem size, which I'll denote as n here, the number of words in your input.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=110.71s
19. Complexity	So remember, decision problems are problems where the answer is just yes or no. This is a very special kind of problem. And even those, almost all of them, cannot be solved.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=728.74s
19. Complexity	Now, what about decision problems? Decision problem is a specification of what we want to solve. So we can think of it as saying, for every input, is the answer yes or no? That's literally what a decision problem is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=842.27s
19. Complexity	It's just a file. So a decision problem is a function from inputs to yes or no. And inputs we're going to say, well, that's a string of bits, which we can associate with a number in N.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=873.17s
19. Complexity	It would be great if you could buy a computer that's lucky. But we don't know how to build such a computer. So what does this mean? So informally, it means your algorithm can make lucky guesses, and it always makes the right guess.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=1405.59s
19. Complexity	And so it goes from here off to infinity in difficulty. And EXP-hard says you're at least as hard as the right extent of the EXP set, or you're harder than that, in a sense that we will formalize in a moment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=2562.73s
19. Complexity	So these are all examples of converting one problem to another. Usually, you convert from-- for algorithms, you convert from a problem you want to solve into a problem that you already know how to solve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=2838.12s
19. Complexity	But longest simple path, where you don't repeat vertices, that's NP-complete. Relatedly, one of the most famous NP-complete problems is traveling salesman problem, finding the shortest path that visits all vertices in a given graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbafQJx1CIA#t=3403.83s
7. Binary Trees, Part 2: AVL	And remember, what does predecessor and successor mean? It's talking about an implicit order in the tree, which is what we call traversal order, which is defined recursively as recursively traverse the left subtree, then output the root, then recursively traverse the right subtree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1JYwHcFfso#t=108.17s
7. Binary Trees, Part 2: AVL	And the key thing that makes this algorithm work is the so-called binary search tree property, which is all the keys in the left subtree of a node are less than the root, or of that node, and that key is less than all the keys in the right subtree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1JYwHcFfso#t=401.14s
7. Binary Trees, Part 2: AVL	The index of that node is size of the subtree minus 1. So let's define the size of a node to be the number of nodes in its subtree-- we were calling that subtree(node)-- including the node itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1JYwHcFfso#t=580.3s
7. Binary Trees, Part 2: AVL	Let's just count how many nodes are in this tree. I'm going to write that as a recurrence, which is the number of nodes in a tree of height h. So if this whole tree has height h, as we said in this picture, if I just subtract 2 from all these numbers, then this one has height h minus 2, and this one has height h minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1JYwHcFfso#t=2294.26s
5. Linear Sorting	That's what we argued. And so for the rest of the time there, we talked about hash families, choosing a hash function randomly from among a large set of hash functions, which had a property that, if I chose this thing randomly and you, generating your input, didn't know which random numbers I was picking, the expectation over my random choice-- me-- I'm the one running the algorithm, not you giving me the input-- that random choice-- my algorithm actually behaves really well in expectation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndgIDO0zQQ#t=252.68s
5. Linear Sorting	This is kind of weird. OK, so what do I actually mean by this? I mean that let's let a be K, when I divide it by n-- integer, the floor-- key integer to divide by n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndgIDO0zQQ#t=1528.98s
5. Linear Sorting	I sorted by the most significant thing. What's the problem here? What did I do wrong? You wanted me to put 42 here and 44 here, right? Because 42 came first in the input and 44 came second, right? OK, if a sorting algorithm maintains this property that, if they are the same thing, then the output maintains their order from the input to the output-- their relative order-- that's what we call a stable sorting algorithm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndgIDO0zQQ#t=2145.79s
5. Linear Sorting	Does that make sense? OK. But we will use that right now to sort larger ranges of numbers. This was exactly the idea. We're going to combine tuple sort, use counting sort as its auxiliary sorting-- stable sorting algorithm to do all its work on these digits.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndgIDO0zQQ#t=2712.16s
5. Linear Sorting	Does that make sense? Yeah. So the idea here-- this is what we call radix sort. Radix sort-- break up integers, max size u, into a base and tuple. So basically, each one of my digits can range from 0 to n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndgIDO0zQQ#t=2856.1s
20. Course Review	"This is efficiency. What does ""good"" mean? Well, that was hard to know at the beginning of our class. And so we set up this model of computation, a framework, through which we could determine how good or bad our algorithms were by saying-- by defining a model of computation, saying what things we can do in constant time, and then just building off of that."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NMtS1ecb3o#t=242.7s
20. Course Review	What are we doing in SORT BOT? We're defining a set of subproblems. These are a set of vertices in a graph. What is the relationship doing? It's saying, what are the relation between the subproblems, essentially defining the edges of a graph? And then this topological order and the base cases, all of these things are just saying, what is the problem that I want to solve on this graph? And how do I compute that for things that don't have any outgoing edges? I need to start writing on the board again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NMtS1ecb3o#t=1408.86s
20. Course Review	But in actuality, our world allows for even more complicated types of operations, like quantum operations, where you're exploiting entanglement and superposition of different atoms to potentially get operations that I can act on my data that are actually provably stronger than the classical models in some sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NMtS1ecb3o#t=3016.69s
20. Course Review	That's what we call a distributed parallel system, where all of the CPUs that you have can interact with each other maybe locally, but don't have access to the same memory system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NMtS1ecb3o#t=3262.23s
Introduction to Algorithms - Problem Session 1: Asymptotic Behavior of Functions and Double-ended...	And what your colleague was saying was to delete this guy and stick it on the front, maybe by using delete last and insert first. That sounds pretty good. Does that do what swap_ends is doing? Swap_ends-- swap the first and last items in the sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSaG9RRc-k#t=1882.44s
Introduction to Algorithms - Problem Session 1: Asymptotic Behavior of Functions and Double-ended...	Amortization means that you have a-- usually a data structure that you're operating on, and you're doing an operation multiple times, and you're getting a benefit because you're doing that operation lots of times.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSaG9RRc-k#t=3115.16s
4. Divide & Conquer: van Emde Boas Trees	We're not going to do it. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: But in general, moving down means, when I want to insert an item, I have to move it down into its sub cluster.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmReJCupbNU#t=3100.67s
R8. NP-Complete Problems	So what about NP? So NP is when the solution is verifiable in polynomial time. So let's say you have an input x and some oracle, which is [INAUDIBLE] run exponential time or is has infinite computation time gives you an answer, so you get x and you get an answer which is either 0 or 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7mqtB6npfE#t=65.485s
R8. NP-Complete Problems	So P is a subset of NP. And so that's it. So now, NP hard problems are problems that are at least as hard to solve as any problem in NP. And so now today we're going to be doing some reductions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7mqtB6npfE#t=101.998s
R8. NP-Complete Problems	So a Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in the graph which starts at some vertex, visits all the other vertices, and comes back to the starting vertex. So in this case, we could do something like go here, and then take this vertex, take this vertex, take this vertex, and come back here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7mqtB6npfE#t=310.525s
R8. NP-Complete Problems	So let's say you have a graph which looks like-- so kind of complementary to the definition of a clique. An independent set is a set of vertices, such that no pair of them has an edge between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7mqtB6npfE#t=905.9s
R1. Matrix Multiplication and the Master Theorem	So just to remind everyone what weighted interval scheduling is. In this problem, we are given a bunch of requests, each with a start time and a finish time. And our goal is to find a subset of them that are compatible, meaning they do not overlap, and that have a largest combined weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09vU-wVwW3U#t=152.08s
R1. Matrix Multiplication and the Master Theorem	Now, we are left with a subproblem that starts after request to j finishes. So I'll write that as Rj, Where I define Rj to be the set of requests where their stop time is later than the finish time of the j-th request.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09vU-wVwW3U#t=344.48s
R1. Matrix Multiplication and the Master Theorem	Strassen algorithm is an efficient algorithm for matrix multiplication, and matrix multiplication is a really useful primitive. It has applications in almost every area I can think of. Circuit simulation, climate simulation, and physics, basically everything.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09vU-wVwW3U#t=1362.27s
22. Cryptography: Encryption	But we're going to actually look at a couple of different public key encryption algorithms today. The classical algorithm, the very first algorithm really that stayed secure, the RSA algorithm. It stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, the initials of the three inventors, invented at MIT in 1977 and still in use today.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TNI2wHmaeI#t=111.86s
22. Cryptography: Encryption	So there's clearly a relationship between this hardness and NP-complete problems, which are computationally hard. And it's not surprising that people have tried to build what are called cryptosystems, which are essentially cryptographic techniques, based on the hardness of NP-complete problems, including graph coloring and knapsack and so on and so forth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TNI2wHmaeI#t=173.34s
22. Cryptography: Encryption	But there's other ways you can obviously name adversaries. So the basic equation here is really straightforward. It's C, which is the cipher text. So a little terminology here, cipher text. m is the plain text or the message.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TNI2wHmaeI#t=294.77s
22. Cryptography: Encryption	And then you can take KA out, right? And it's still locked, because you have KB. So this commutativity between the locks and essentially the keys is what's required. And so now, let's move away from pirates and go into the cryptography domain, pure mathematical domain, and see how this turns into what's called the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which is a key exchange algorithm or a protocol that under certain conditions give you exactly what you see here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TNI2wHmaeI#t=1265.82s
22. Cryptography: Encryption	And she thinks she's exchanged it with Bob. And she's, in fact, communicating with the pirates. So there's a man in the middle attack, which corresponds to the pirates having their own locks and keys.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TNI2wHmaeI#t=1964.37s
22. Cryptography: Encryption	And they produced cryptosystems, public key cryptosystems, based on Knapsack that look fantastic. And they work from a functionality standpoint in the sense that you would use this Knapsack-- and I'll give you a sense of how this is done in a minute-- problem to encrypt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TNI2wHmaeI#t=4240.67s
R6. Greedy Algorithms	ki is the weight of every metal that you will give to the person. So you're taking ki of metal i, and you are going to-- and you have to ensure, so basically, you have to ensure that some summation of ki Ci over all i is equal to T. And in doing so you want to minimize the summation over all ki.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QcPo_DWJk4#t=65.099s
R6. Greedy Algorithms	And the completion time for a certain process in the middle is just the sum of all times before it. That's completion time. And now what you want to do is you want to minimize the average completion time, which is summation over all the completion times over n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QcPo_DWJk4#t=372.13s
R6. Greedy Algorithms	Let's say someone comes up to you and tells you, OK, I have a better sequence. I have a sequence, let's say, called-- let's say I have a sequence of p1 to pn.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QcPo_DWJk4#t=491.43s
R6. Greedy Algorithms	So you can always do better by swapping two inversions. So that out of sorted order is called an inversion. So if you solve an inversion, you always get a better result.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QcPo_DWJk4#t=678.26s
R6. Greedy Algorithms	So how would you handle this situation. So let's say you're in the middle of a job and you get a bunch of new requests. So current set is all these existing jobs plus some other things you get in here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QcPo_DWJk4#t=1231.316s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	Or it could be on one machine that has multiple processors, multi processors that memory. Much of computing is distributed algorithms now. They solve problems like communication on the internet, data management over a network, allocating resources in a network setting, synchronizing, reaching agreement among different agents at remote locations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=55.4s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	And the degree of u is the size of the neighborhood, the number of neighbors of the vertex. OK so we start with the graph. But now we're going to plunk down a process, some kind of active entity at each vertex of the graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=373.73s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	This week I'm not going to talk about what happens when you introduce failures because we just don't have time. A lot of distributed computing theory deals with what happens when some of the components in your system fail.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=431.7s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	Maximal means that whatever set you choose, you can't add any more nodes without violating independence. So now this should look something like a couple of homework problems that you had from the beginning and recently.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=1532.96s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	I'm going to go onto a new idea, more conceptual stuff. Familiar problem, breadth-first spanning trees, setting up breadth-first paths to every node, but we're going to study it in our new setting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=2940.19s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	Spanning means they should reach all the vertices. And breadth-first means that if a vertex is at a distance d from v0, it will appear at depth d in this spanning tree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=3060.04s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	You don't model the local computation time. You're moving more toward an asynchronous model, where the steps can take differing amounts of time. Here we just assume you have an abstract model, where everybody does stuff at once, in each round.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=3350.03s
19. Synchronous Distributed Algorithms: Symmetry-Breaking. Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	So now we're going to use what we call a convergecast strategy. Broadcast is sending things out. Convergecast is fanning in information back to the top of the tree. So the convergecast would say, all right, so the leaves would send a message to their parents saying they're done.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBmcbbJNf4#t=4017.14s
11. Dynamic Programming: All-Pairs Shortest Paths	So that's the motivation. Yeah, I guess in some sense, internet routing is another situation where at any moment you may need to know the shortest path to get to-- the fewest hop path say to get to an internet site.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgFUwOaoIw#t=626.1s
11. Dynamic Programming: All-Pairs Shortest Paths	A ring is an algebra where you define plus and times, and you have distributivity. Semi-ring, there's no minus, because min has no inverse. There's no way from the min to re-compute the arguments, right? No matter what you apply to it, you can't-- you've lost information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgFUwOaoIw#t=2715.71s
11. Dynamic Programming: All-Pairs Shortest Paths	So let me briefly tell you about that problem. It's called transitive closure. Transitive closure is, I just want to know is there a path from i to j. So it's going to be 1, if there exists a path from i to j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgFUwOaoIw#t=2786.07s
15. Linear Programming: LP, reductions, Simplex	SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Good morning, everyone. So we have a singleton lecture today on linear programming, which is general purpose optimization technique that you can use to solve a whole bunch of problems, including ones that we've seen in 6.046 and previously in 006.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwMz2fJwUCg#t=21.002s
15. Linear Programming: LP, reductions, Simplex	But what I have here is I can either minimize or maximize-- we had a minimization problem-- for the political problem, minimize the linear objective function subject to linear inequalities or equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwMz2fJwUCg#t=1122.93s
15. Linear Programming: LP, reductions, Simplex	But I may not get through all of the steps to get you the optimum for this particular example given how much time we have. The most important concept in simplex is yet another form of representation for simplex, which says that you can represent the LP, not in standard form, but in slack form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwMz2fJwUCg#t=3611.53s
15. Linear Programming: LP, reductions, Simplex	So I'm going to tell you what slack form is. And then what we're going to do is, the flow of simplex, algorithmic flow, is to convert one slack form into and equivalent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwMz2fJwUCg#t=3639.99s
15. Linear Programming: LP, reductions, Simplex	So you're going to convert through three slack forms. And then finally, when you get to this fourth slack form, you see that you have an optimal solution. And how does that work? You're going to have the notion of a basic solution, where we set all non-basic variables to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwMz2fJwUCg#t=4007.63s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	ERIK DEMAINE: All right, let's get started. Today we're going to continue the theme of randomization and data structures. Last time we saw skip lists. Skip lists solve the predecessor-successor problem. You can search for an item and if it's not there, you get the closest item on either side in log n with high probability.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=22.42s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	The hash tables are the data structure. The dictionary is the problem or the abstract data type. So what we're trying to do today, as in most data structures, is maintain a dynamic set of items.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=122.22s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	Hash is an English word since the 1650's, so it's pretty old. It means literally cut into small pieces. It's usually used in a culinary sense, like these days you have corned beef hash or something.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=734.22s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	But the theoretically cooler one is called perfect hashing. Universal hashing, we're going to guarantee there are very few conflicts in expectation. Perfect hashing , we're going to guarantee there are zero conflicts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=887.44s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	The word RAM assumes that in general we're manipulating integers. And the integers fit in a word. And the computational assumption is that manipulating a constant number of words and doing essentially any operation you want on constant number of words takes constant time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=2198.24s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	But we're going to solve the static dictionary problem which is when you have no inserts and deletes. You're given the keys up front. You're given n keys. You want to build a table that supports search.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=3373.42s
8. Randomization: Universal & Perfect Hashing	Sorry. Expectation. Let's first compute the expectation and then we'll talk about a tail bound which is the probability that we're much bigger than the expectation. First thing is I claim the expectation is linear.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0lJ2k0sl1g#t=4537.64s
14. Incremental Improvement: Matching	And how much can you increase this flow by? How much can you increase f by? That is termed the residual capacity. And the residual capacity of an augmenting path is simply C f of P, that's what we're going to call it, C f of P, equals the minimum value of the residual capacities along the path.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_T4iTzPCU#t=459.06s
14. Incremental Improvement: Matching	But let's say that I'm picking something where there's an edge in G, the original flow network from u to v. So the edge that I've drawn here, the dark edge, is an edge between u and v in G. And that edge had a certain capacity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_T4iTzPCU#t=1804.17s
14. Incremental Improvement: Matching	Then you could get a polynomial bound that did not depend on the capacities for the complexity and therefore iteration count of Ford-Fulkerson. So that was their contribution. And so the breadth-first path is the shortest path in G f from s to t if you count where each edge has weight 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_T4iTzPCU#t=2668.19s
14. Incremental Improvement: Matching	OK so that's usually what you see when you see a snapshot. OK now I'm going to also add rij, which are the games that these teams play against each other. And the reason is simple.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_T4iTzPCU#t=3339.38s
R5. Dynamic Programming	LING REN: Everyone, today we're going to look at dynamic programming again. So I think I have mentioned several times, so you should all know it by heart now, the dynamic programming, its main idea is divide the problem into subproblems and reuse the results of the problems you already solved.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krZI60lKPek#t=21.15s
R5. Dynamic Programming	How many distinct path are there that can take the robot to its destination? Any ideas how to solve that? Go ahead. AUDIENCE: So, we define subproblems as the number of distinct paths from some point x,y to m,n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krZI60lKPek#t=119.42s
R5. Dynamic Programming	Has anyone not heard of this problem? Knapsack means you have a bunch of items. You want to pack these into a bag, and the bag has a certain size. So each item has a certain value, and you want to pack the items that have the largest combined value into your bag.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krZI60lKPek#t=695.14s
7. Randomization: Skip Lists	The skip list is a relatively young data structure invented by a guy called Bill Pugh in 1989, so not much older than you guys. It's relatively easy to implement as you'll see.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9OSRKJuzM#t=105.21s
7. Randomization: Skip Lists	So what you're going to have to do is when you start inserting, you're going to have to decide if you're going to what is called promote these elements or not. And the notion of a promotion is that you are going up and duplicating this inserted element some number of levels up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9OSRKJuzM#t=2091.06s
R7. Network Flow and Matching	OK? OK. Now, to prove that bound, we first need a lemma, which we call monotonic. So let me define delta f v. This is the length of the shortest path from s, from the source, to v, which is a node in a graph, the length of that in rescue graph of f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdxkgAjsDA#t=564.48s
R7. Network Flow and Matching	Question? AUDIENCE: Sorry, I'm lost at what delta f prime is versus delta. PROFESSOR: OK. Delta f of a node is the shortest path from source to that node in G of f, which is the residual graph given a flow.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdxkgAjsDA#t=1107.0s
R7. Network Flow and Matching	So f is, well, some flow, and f prime is the flow after we augmenting a certain path. So f prime is one step after f. OK. How many people get that now? Still not everyone.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdxkgAjsDA#t=1124.65s
R7. Network Flow and Matching	So we have a graph like that. And each edge-- if there is an edge, that means this person is capable of performing that task. And the problem is that-- find the matching, which means the assignment from people to tasks, such that we get as many tasks done as possible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdxkgAjsDA#t=2171.44s
R7. Network Flow and Matching	So if I'm smarter, I'll assign one of these guys to that task and have this person handle the other task. Is the problem clear? So this is called bipartite graph, because-- well, which means you can partition a graph into two parts, and within each part, there's no edge connecting any pair of vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdxkgAjsDA#t=2214.26s
R7. Network Flow and Matching	OK. I'm going to give it a try. If you don't get that, that's fine. AUDIENCE: Can you say again what cover is? PROFESSOR: OK. Cover-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]? PROFESSOR: Cover is a set of nodes such that every edge in the graph is connected to at least one of the nodes, in a cover.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdxkgAjsDA#t=2694.396s
5. Amortization: Amortized Analysis	I want to say an insert costs one bound amortized and maybe a delete costs some other bound. So what you get to do is assign a cost for each operation. I should call it an amortized cost, such that you preserve the sum of those costs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpzavN3Mco#t=453.93s
5. Amortization: Amortized Analysis	I don't get coins over here. So when we double, the last n over 2 items have coins, and so the amortized cost of the doubling operation is going to be the real cost, which is sum theta n minus the number of coins I can remove and their value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpzavN3Mco#t=1541.74s
5. Amortization: Amortized Analysis	So from an analysis perspective, you're thinking about the future. What could potentially charge me? Again, you can define the amortized cost of an operation is going to be the actual cost minus the total charge to the past.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpzavN3Mco#t=1765.225s
5. Amortization: Amortized Analysis	So for 2-3 trees, we said deletions were free, and we did that with the coin invariant, that there was one coin of size log i for each i. You could instead say, when I delete an item, I'm going to charge it to the insert that made n this current value, because that insert paid log n the actual cost, so it can afford to pay another log n to pay for the deletion of some other item, the one we're currently deleting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpzavN3Mco#t=2449.98s
5. Amortization: Amortized Analysis	These are usually called a-b trees, generalization of b trees, where you get to specify the lower bound and the upper bound, as long as a-- what's the way-- as long as a is strictly less than b over 2, then this argument will work.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpzavN3Mco#t=4280.43s
10. Dynamic Programming: Advanced DP	Sometimes it's called longest palindromic subsequence. And as we'll talk about, subsequence means that it can be non-contiguous. So you could skip letters in a sequence of letters and you would still have a subsequence corresponding to that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw1k46ywN6E#t=56.63s
10. Dynamic Programming: Advanced DP	All right. Those of you who are missing Python, who loved 6006 in Python, let's talk about how you would actually solve this using dynamic programming. And so what we want is lij, which is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for xij.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw1k46ywN6E#t=637.9s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	We'll get to completeness in a moment. 3SAT-- SAT stands for satisfiability. So in 3SAT, the input to the problem looks something like this. I'm just going to give an example. And in case you've forgotten your weird logic notation, this is an and.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=349.08s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	You could have no negations. You could here have one negation, two negations, any number of negations per clause. These groups of three-- these or of three things, three literals, are called clauses.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=429.5s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	So it also requires nonpolynomial time, something larger than polynomial time. What does at least as hard mean though? We're going to define it in terms of reductions. Reduction from one problem to another is just a polynomial time algorithm, regular deterministic polynomial time, that converts an input to the problem A into an equivalent input to problem B. Equivalent means that it has the same yes or no answer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=1158.71s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	So that means I'm given-- I don't get to choose. I'm given one of these formulas. And I have to convert it into an equivalent Super Mario Brother instance. So I have to convert it into a level, a hypothetical level of Super Mario Brothers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=1972.1s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	Now, what do I do once Mario decides that this is a true thing? What I'm going to do is have-- this is called a gadget by the way. In general, most NP-hardness proofs use these things called gadgets, which is just saying, we take various features of the input, and we convert them into corresponding features on the output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=2108.53s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	This is the set of all triples X, Y, and Z, or X is in X, Y is in Y, and Z is in Z. But not all triples are allowed. Only some subset of triples is allowed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=2867.1s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	Oh no, target sum is given. Target sum is the sum over 2. But anyway, we're going to build our target rectangle to be-- it's actually going to be really big. It's going to be 2 by 3 times t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=4671.225s
16. Complexity: P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions	And it's called 4-partition. 4-partition, you're given n integers, as usual. Say set is A. And you want to split those integers into n over 4 quadruples of the same sum. So this would be the sum of A divided by n over four.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZifpgyH_4#t=4926.09s
18. Complexity: Fixed-Parameter Algorithms	So as in vertex cover, we're given a graph G. And I'm going to think of the decision version of vertex cover. So we're given a non-negative integer k. And we want to know-- is there a vertex cover of size k-- say, less than or equal to k-- is there a vertex cover? Remember a vertex cover is a set of vertices that cover all the edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q-jmGrmxKs#t=512.039s
18. Complexity: Fixed-Parameter Algorithms	That's going to be our parameter. OK. And most problems, a lot of problems, especially decision versions of optimization problems-- like before, we were minimizing the vertex cover-- this is the decision version where we want to decide whether there's one of size of most k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q-jmGrmxKs#t=583.01s
18. Complexity: Fixed-Parameter Algorithms	It's going to be called a kernelization procedure. Kernelization algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm. Head back to polynomial time land. You can think of it as a reduction, but with NP-hardness, we reduced from one problem a to another problem b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q-jmGrmxKs#t=2130.622s
R9. Approximation Algorithms: Traveling Salesman Problem	So, now, we need to show that this is somehow bounded by a star G. So how do you do that? Well, look at H star G. What is H star G? H star G is just a cycle, which goes through the optimal cycle, which goes through all the vertices and comes back to the parent vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM5MW5NKZJg#t=586.31s
R9. Approximation Algorithms: Traveling Salesman Problem	So it's a spanning tree, but it's not the minimum spanning tree. So you know that H star G, the cost of H star of G, is greater than equal to the cost of H star of G minus the edge we removed, is greater than equal to the cost of T. Make sense? So you remove one edge, and then that is still greater than the minimum spanning tree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM5MW5NKZJg#t=635.298s
R9. Approximation Algorithms: Traveling Salesman Problem	So we took all the odd degree vertices, and made a perfect matching, the minimum cost perfect matching. So we added edges just to make everything even degree. Then, we took the Euler circuit on that graph, and we removed duplicates.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM5MW5NKZJg#t=1823.195s
2. Divide & Conquer: Convex Hull, Median Finding	This is just a matter of convenience. And no two have the same y-coordinate. And then finally, no three in a line. Because we want to be able to look at pairs of points and find these segments. And it just gets kind of inconvenient. You have to do special cases if there of them are on a line. And so the convex hull itself is the smallest polygon containing all points in s. And we're going to call that ch of s-- convex hull of s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzeYI7p9MjU#t=697.27s
2. Divide & Conquer: Convex Hull, Median Finding	And so in general, we're going to define, given a set of n numbers, define rank of x as the numbers in the set that are greater than-- I'm sorry, less than or equal to x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzeYI7p9MjU#t=3217.07s
24. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms: Searching & Sorting	Now in the analysis, again, I'm allowed to know b. So let's say b is b. And let's consider the level of recursion. Let's say the first level of recursion, where the triangles have less than or equal to b nodes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6EWVBNCxsc#t=1598.63s
R11. Cryptography: More Primitives	It outputs a signature, which we refer to as sigma. And verify takes a public key, a message, and a signature, and outputs on either true or false. It either accepts the signature or reject.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLOhV4XQ_tI#t=114.09s
R11. Cryptography: More Primitives	Sigma 2, sigma 3, sigma 4. So I said a hash tree. And guess what's the next step to do? AUDIENCE: Cross the hashes. PROFESSOR: Yeah. Exactly. We're going to create a sigma 5, which is the hash of sigma 1, concatenated with sigma 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLOhV4XQ_tI#t=2217.29s
9. Augmentation: Range Trees	And we'll start out with a very simple one, which I call easy tree augmentation, which will include subtree size as a special case. So with easy tree augmentation, the idea is you have a tree, like an AVL tree, or 2-3 tree, or something like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVka6z1hu-I#t=97.719s
9. Augmentation: Range Trees	So the idea of level linking is very simple. Let me draw a 2-3 tree. Not a very impressive 2-3 tree. I guess I don't feel like drawing too much. Level linking is the idea of, in addition to these child and parent pointers, we're going to add links on all the levels.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVka6z1hu-I#t=1665.69s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	And we can do a termination using convergecast, and there's some applications we talked about as well. All right, and then at the end of the hour, we started talking about a generalization, a breadth-first spanning trees, which adds weights so you have shortest paths trees.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=419.25s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	You can have many paths that are set up that look good after just one round, but then they get corrected as the rounds go on. You get much lower weight paths by having a roundabout, multi-hop path to a node.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=592.21s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	On the other end, if somebody is keeping track of its children, it has to make adjustments too because things can change during the algorithm. Let's say a process keeps track of its children in some set, it has a set children.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=946.15s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	We'll have all these components, and we'll be modeling all of them. Processes still have their ports. They need not, in general, have identifiers. What's a channel? A channel is-- it's a kind of an automaton, infinite state automaton, that has inputs and some outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=1548.54s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	Usually that's assumed to be very small, so let's say it's 0. We can get a very simple, pessimistic really, upper bound that says the real time for finishing the whole thing is of the order of the diameter of the network times the number of nodes times little d is the amount of time for a message queue to deliver its first message.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=2262.8s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	We'll have a queue there. The key step, the relaxation step, is what happens when you receive a new estimate of the best distance. This is weighted distance, now, from a neighbor.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=3414.23s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	He one the Turing Award last year-- other techniques, like taking global snapshots of the entire system while it's running. In addition to talking about networks, as we've been doing this week, we'll talk about shared memory, multi-processors accessing shared memory.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=4217.7s
20. Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms: Shortest-Paths Spanning Trees	If you want to have coherent access to data that's stored at many locations, you need to have some interesting distributed algorithms. Self stabilization-- if you plunge your system into some arbitrary state, and you'd like it to converge to a good state, that's the topic of self stabilization.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjwWn-WrdI#t=4255.28s
21. Cryptography: Hash Functions	And basically what we're saying here is the behavior is indistinguishable from random. So we're going to have to use non-linearity, things that are called non-linear feedback shift registers, to create pseudo-random functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqqOXndnvic#t=1775.3s
21. Cryptography: Hash Functions	Or in case of Vickrey auctions, where the second highest bidder wins, now just be a little bit below you, right? So that's the kind of thing that you want to think about when it comes to non-malleability, or malleability, where you want a strong relationship between two strings that are related in some ordered fashion, like x equals-- x prime equals x plus 1, or just x prime equals 2 times x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqqOXndnvic#t=1993.54s
21. Cryptography: Hash Functions	And what digital signatures respond to are that you have two operations. You have signing and verification. So signing means that you create a signature sigma that is the sign using your private key, your secret key, off a message M. So you're saying this is this message, it came from me, right? That's what signing means.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqqOXndnvic#t=3699.93s
13. Incremental Improvement: Max Flow, Min Cut	So we're going to have distinguished vertices, two distinguished vertices. And we're going to call them the source, s, and a sink, t. And so the basic idea here-- and just to sort of set things up right up front-- is that there's going to be some flow coming out of s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZGlgzr_As#t=209.3s
13. Incremental Improvement: Max Flow, Min Cut	OK? And a residual network, as its name implies, is something that has residual capacities. It's the network that points you to places where you can increase the flow, because there's capacity left.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZGlgzr_As#t=4092.25s
23. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms: Medians & Matrices	Presumably you set the block size to make these two things roughly equal, and so then latency and bandwidth are kind of the same thing. That's the idea. But really, we're just going to think about counting latency, which is how many times do I have to request to block and wait for it to come over, and how much does it cost to write a block? How many times do I write a block? I'm not going to worry about how much physical time it takes me to do either of those things; I'm just going to count them and assume that that is what I need to minimize.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSqbjfCCLrU#t=1053.64s
23. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms: Medians & Matrices	So I'm going to count-- we call these memory transfers-- transfers of blocks between levels, between these two levels. This is the number of blocks read from or written to disk. We're going to view accesses to the cache as free.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSqbjfCCLrU#t=1082.41s
23. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms: Medians & Matrices	Instead of our base case being constant, it's going to be order B or M. What don't I need? So now let's going to median finding. Median finding, you're given an unsorted array.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSqbjfCCLrU#t=2702.41s
R2. 2-3 Trees and B-Trees	So split. And there's something which is called a merge, which we'll come to later when we're doing deletion. But a split is-- very intuitively, it splits the node into two parts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOb1tuEZ2X4#t=943.79s
6. Randomization: Matrix Multiply, Quicksort	But it kind of has a little bit in common with them, and it's our example of a Vegas algorithm. So what happens at randomized quicksort? An x is chosen at random from the array, A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNB2lADK3_s#t=4082.744s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	I'm going to switch to the summation notation. I didn't go to high school, but I assume in high school algebra you learn this. ck is the sum of j equals 0 to k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=531.28s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	Sorry. So, I can give you a sequence of roots. This is the fundamental theorem of algebra that every polynomial is uniquely determined by its set of roots. If you allow roots with multiplicity then every polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=961.951s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	So that's the magical transformation we're going to cover, and it is called the fast Fourier transfer. Fast Fourier transform is the algorithm. Discrete Fourier transform is that transformation mathematically. Cool. So the whole name of the game is converting from coefficient representation to samples, or vice versa.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=1358.07s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	x squared is the set of squares of all numbers in x. So I'm changing my set x. I started with a polynomial a and a set x. Recursively, I'm doing a different polynomial of half the degree-- half the number of terms-- but with a different set of the same size.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=2255.44s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	That algorithm with these xi's is FFT. So let me write this somewhere. It kind of snuck up on us. This is the algorithm we were aiming to find. Fast Fourier transform is that divide and conquer algorithm on the right.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=3628.09s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	Let's say that we're given two polynomials, a and b, represented in coefficient form. What we need is-- I'll call it a star, which is the result of running FFT on a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=3828.83s
3. Divide & Conquer: FFT	Now I have the samples of a star at the n-th roots of unity-- these guys-- and I have the samples of b at the exact same points-- the n-th roots of unity-- so I can compute c star, the transform version-- the DFT of c-- is just the, I mean, c star k equals a star k times b star k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMn0Kt18tg#t=3865.97s
17. Complexity: Approximation Algorithms	OK? And that's essentially what a scheme is, where we're going to take an input-- an additional input-- epsilon, strictly greater than zero. And for any fixed epsilon, the scheme-- it's an approximation scheme as opposed to an algorithm-- is a 1 plus epsilon approximation algorithm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEz1J9wY2iM#t=439.07s
17. Complexity: Approximation Algorithms	And that's what's called set cover. So set cover tries to cover a set with subsets. And it's very useful in optimization where you have overlapping sets, maybe it's schedules, it's tasks, it's people getting invited to dinner, et cetera, and you want to make sure everybody gets invited.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEz1J9wY2iM#t=2134.282s
1. Course Overview, Interval Scheduling	It's breaking of a problem into smaller problems and getting efficiency that way. Merge sort is a classic algorithm that follows the divide and conquer paradigm. If you're going to take it to a new level.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P-yW7LQr08#t=309.67s
1. Course Overview, Interval Scheduling	But just to give you a slightly better definition of greedy than what I've said so far, a greedy algorithm is a myopic algorithm that does two things. It processes the input one piece at a time with no apparent look ahead.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P-yW7LQr08#t=1552.13s
1. Course Overview, Interval Scheduling	s star is optimal. s double star is optimal. Now I'm going to define L prime as the set of intervals with s of i greater than or equal to f of i1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P-yW7LQr08#t=3193.23s
1. Course Overview, Interval Scheduling	So you can still have a weight of 1 for all requests, but you have something like A of i belonging subset of T is a set of machines that i runs on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P-yW7LQr08#t=4874.65s
12. Greedy Algorithms: Minimum Spanning Tree	Spanning means it contains all the vertices, so implicit here, I guess, is subtree or subgraph. You're given a graph. You want a spanning tree of that graph. It's going to be a tree that lives inside the graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwnms5iRBU#t=147.35s
12. Greedy Algorithms: Minimum Spanning Tree	And now u is in S, v is not in S. So if you look at that path, for a while, you might stay in S, but eventually you have to leave S, which means there has to be an edge like this one, which I'll call it e prime, which transitions from S to V minus S.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwnms5iRBU#t=2150.71s
12. Greedy Algorithms: Minimum Spanning Tree	OK, when I do that, all I do is say, look, greedy choice property guarantees there's a minimum spanning tree that contains e. Because we extracted the min from the queue, and the key values are this, as I was arguing before, that is the minimum overall edge that crosses the cut.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKwnms5iRBU#t=3712.78s
22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum	The gradient of F points perpendicular. But what about the Hessian, the second derivative? What is that telling me about that surface in particular when the Hessian is 0 or other surfaces? What does the Hessian tell me about-- I'm thinking of the Hessian at a particular point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeRwohPuUHQ#t=583.33s
22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum	I assume it's short. Nobody ever told me this. I assume it's short for argument. The word argument is a kind of long word for the value of x. If I have a function f of x, f, I call it function and x is the argument of that function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeRwohPuUHQ#t=1203.52s
22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum	Oh! Can we get any idea what are the derivatives of the determinant? Oh my god. How did I never get into this? So are you with me so far? This is going to be derivatives of determinant, the strength of all these variables divided by the determinant, because that's what the log achieved.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeRwohPuUHQ#t=1656.16s
22. Gradient Descent: Downhill to a Minimum	And I'll work with that example. So here's gradient descent. Is xk plus 1 is xk minus Sk the step size times the gradient of f at xk. So the only thing left that requires us to input some decision making is a step size, the learning rate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeRwohPuUHQ#t=2060.48s
Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication	So I'm going to put the Pj squareds here and the lambda there. What does this tell me? I've taken the derivative with respect to the Pj's, and I got this equation for each j because I took the derivative, the partial derivative with respect to each of the Pj's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ykhV15wLw#t=2923.45s
16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values	So I've got sigma, a number of times the derivative of u times u itself, the dot product-- the derivative of u with dot product with u. And that equals? 0, I hope, because of this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdTvkFsqcDc#t=827.76s
16. Derivatives of Inverse and Singular Values	GILBERT STRANG: The rank. The rank of matrix is the equivalent. So I don't know about the zero. Nobody else calls it A0. So I better not. It's the rank. So again, the rank is not a norm, because if I double the matrix, I don't double the rank.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdTvkFsqcDc#t=2483.06s
4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors	So what do I-- what are the key facts to know? Eigenvalues are real numbers, if the matrix is. I'm thinking of real symmetric matrices. Of course, other real matrices could have imaginary eigenvalues.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k095NdrHxY4#t=1529.97s
26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning	So a function of a function of a function, that's called composition, composing function. So this is a composition. I don't know if there's a standard symbol for starting with F1 and do some composition and do some composition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx00s7nYmRM#t=1574.36s
26. Structure of Neural Nets for Deep Learning	Everybody with it? And now, I take that function, that surface which just has two parts, and I put in another fold. OK, how many parts have I got now? I think four, am I right? Four parts, yes, because this will be different from this, because it was folded along that line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx00s7nYmRM#t=2220.57s
23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)	I'm just not an artist, but I think I'm closer. So this is-- those are the level sets. Those are the sets f of x equal constant. And in our model problem, f of x is x1 squared-- or let's say x squared plus b-y squared equal constant with small b-- b below 1 and maybe far below 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrEcHhoJxjM#t=288.72s
23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)	The decay-- the term that tells you how fast the decay is-- is smaller. So you're taking kth power. So let me-- I'll write that down, if that's all right. I didn't plan to do-- to reveal the final result at the beginning of the lecture.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrEcHhoJxjM#t=608.77s
23. Accelerating Gradient Descent (Use Momentum)	E1 depends on lambda. So we have a little algebra problem. And this is what I described as a miracle-- the fact that this little algebra problem-- the eigenvalues of that matrix, e1 and e2, which depend on lambda in some way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrEcHhoJxjM#t=2056.239s
25. Stochastic Gradient Descent	So n can be huge. d, the dimensionality, the vectors that we are working with-- the raw vectors-- that can also be pretty large. Think of x is an image. If it's a megapixel image, wow, d's like a million already.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3AiUhwHQ28#t=364.755s
25. Stochastic Gradient Descent	yi's are the labels-- cat not cat, or maybe a multiclass. And then you have a transfer function called a deep neural network which takes raw images as input and generates a prediction whether this is a dog or not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3AiUhwHQ28#t=606.8s
25. Stochastic Gradient Descent	And then people who do a lot of statistics, maximum likelihood estimation. This is log likelihood over n observations. You want to maximize log likelihood. Once again, just a finite sum. So pretty much most of the problems that we're interested in machine learning and statistics, when I write them down as an optimization problem, they look like these finite sum problems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3AiUhwHQ28#t=655.27s
25. Stochastic Gradient Descent	Each thread or each core or subcore or small chip or what have, you depending on your hardware, can be working with one stochastic gradient. So mini-batches, the larger the mini batch the more things you can do in parallel.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3AiUhwHQ28#t=2758.33s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	And you'll know about the expected mean. Let me complete that. What's the expected mean? So this is the expectation of the value x where we get x1 with probability P1 along to xn with probability Pn.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=55.98s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	It's the expected value, the average value of x minus m squared. And in general, of course, the expected-- this covariance matrix I could express with that E notation. But let me just stretch it as far as what would be the expected value of any function of x? Well, we've got n possible outputs, x1 to xn.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=149.68s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	What is the mean of y? The mean value, the sum of probabilities times y's. You're supposed to recognize it. This is the sum of probabilities. And my y's are the xi minus the mean squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=1603.14s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	So I guess what we're seeing, I sort of realized today, we're seeing for the first time a tensor. A tensor is a three-way structure, three-way matrix you could say. So I guess I think of this instead of a square like that, an ordinary matrix, I have to think of a cube, right? I have a cube with two rows, two columns, and two whatevers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=2276.44s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	But some of those are going to have probability zero, the joint probability. If I've glued coin 1 to coin 3, then the probability of jointly seeing heads on one, whatever on two, tails on 3 will be 0, right? Because that can't happen if I've glued coins 1 and 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=2406.09s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	What's the meaning of the sum of Pij over the i's? What does that quantity look like? So that's a probability. Pij is the probability of getting a certain i and a certain j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=2816.11s
20. Definitions and Inequalities	So it's going to be-- and it should be this is between x and the mean of x. Mean 1 I could call it or mean of x. And y, the distance from the mean of y times-- so it's going to be column times row-- same x minus the mean of x, y minus the mean of y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrDkb2MAwSA#t=2918.38s
Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax	The rank is the dimension of the column-- everybody sees that you get a line? Because any combination x1 of that plus x2 of that plus x3 of that is going to go along that line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqIkSHSmyc#t=707.18s
Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax	Then now, we're moving into the idea of independent columns, and the number of independent columns is the rank. So the rank-- shall I write that somewhere? Maybe here. The rank is the number of independent columns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqIkSHSmyc#t=996.47s
6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)	Now we've seen that form before. We know that this is a symmetric matrix, symmetric and even positive definite. So what are the v's? The v's are the eigenvectors of A transpose A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYz83XPxiZo#t=895.84s
6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)	So the sigma transpose sigma, which will be the sigma squared are the eigenvalues of A transpose A. Good! Sort of by looking for the correct thing, U sigma V transpose and then just using the U transpose U equal identity, we got it back to something we perfectly recognize.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYz83XPxiZo#t=935.82s
6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)	And then it was discovered, but not much used, for oh, 100 years probably. And then people saw that it was exactly the right thing, and data matrices became important, which are large rectangular matrices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYz83XPxiZo#t=1586.43s
Lecture 11: Minimizing ‖x‖ Subject to Ax = b	And all the Arnoldi Lanczos algorithm is is that same Gram-Schmidt idea applied to these Krylov vectors. So Arnoldi-Lanczos-- Arnoldi is for any matrix and Lanczos is for a symmetric matrix where you get some special benefit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuEW9pG9oxE#t=2767.12s
Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices	PROFESSOR: It's the set of solutions to Ax equals 0, right. Null space is all solutions to Ax equal 0. So the null space has vector-- these vectors in it-- the x's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or6C4yBk_SY#t=1950.64s
14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse	This is really recursive least squares. Recursive least squares-- what I mean by recursive is new data comes in. It changes the answer, but it doesn't change our method. And then the Kalman filter is a very, very big deal in guidance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhSk_Lw2X_U#t=1706.17s
14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse	So that would be weighted least squares, or correlated least squares. So these squares-- let me just remind you, if I can write it here. So least squares-- standard. Standard meaning that data is not correlated.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhSk_Lw2X_U#t=1880.01s
14. Low Rank Changes in A and Its Inverse	It all has the same variance. These are the statistics words that I'm using last time and this, but that I'll talk about properly. So the standard one is the covari-- the standard means covariance equal the identity matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhSk_Lw2X_U#t=1913.97s
15. Matrices A(t) Depending on t, Derivative = dA/dt	One is small change when I'm doing calculus and I'm letting a delta t go to 0. The other is full size, order 1 change, where I will not be able to give you a formula for the new lambdas, but I'll be able to tell you important facts about them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3SmljnD_nQ#t=796.15s
33. Neural Nets and the Learning Function	OK. So the question is, can we recover the positions from the distances? In fact, there's also a question, are there always positions from given distances? And I mentioned several applications. I've already spoken about wireless sensor networks, where you can measure travel times between them, between the sensors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3-WFKCW-tY#t=1772.48s
Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!	A circulant matrix-- let me put it here-- a circulant matrix, every circulant matrix is C0 times the identity circulant plus C1 times the single shift plus C2 times the double shift plus C3 times the triple shift.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-bXJIa7QVI#t=1905.56s
Lecture 30: Completing a Rank-One Matrix, Circulants!	So that's the final step here. What are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P? So eigenvectors, eigenvalues for P equal 1, 1, 1, and 1, say. And otherwise zeros. So somebody mentioned that the vector of 1, 1, 1, 1, that is an eigenvector, because if I do that multiplication, it shifts this vector down and cyclically around.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-bXJIa7QVI#t=2762.84s
12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values	It's up there. But key person's name is Hessenberg. As I say, that's a Hessenberg matrix. So Hessenberg matrix is a matrix with one triangular plus one more diagonal, but lots of zeros.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d32WV1rKoVk#t=1384.26s
7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A	Do you know the right name for this? So that double bar around a matrix is called the-- the norm of the matrix, the norm. So I have to say something about matrix norms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4f7K9XF04k#t=244.35s
7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A	So let me mention the L2 norm. That is the largest singular value. So that's an important measure of the-- sort of the size of a matrix. I'm talking here about a general m by n matrix A. Sigma 1 is an important norm-- often called the L2 norm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4f7K9XF04k#t=313.81s
7. Eckart-Young: The Closest Rank k Matrix to A	The hypotenuse-- the length of the hypotenuse in n dimensional space. That's the L2 norm, because of that 2. The L1 norm of a vector is just add up those pieces without squaring and square rooting them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4f7K9XF04k#t=372.85s
19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle	You have to use good codes and pay attention to computing those saddle point values. So is there anything nice I can do with saddle points? How does one think about saddle points? So again, saddle point is defined by first derivatives equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7CvGnebO0#t=507.94s
19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle	It's not as close as you would want. But fitting by a full perfect filling, a high degree polynomial, is certainly overfitting. Where is the boundary? I'm sure people know about this, but I think it is something we could learn from.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7CvGnebO0#t=1601.31s
19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle	Question? Anyway, you can email me. You probably see that see what the model looks like. Then the second one I've taken that first jump into, networks. Made a very simple network without any hidden layers at all actually.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7CvGnebO0#t=1872.5s
19. Saddle Points Continued, Maxmin Principle	So the sample means, we've done an experiment. We've got some output. The expected mean means we know probabilities, but we haven't used them yet. So this uses actual output. And the sample mean is simply-- shall I just say, m for mean-- well, these two are importantly different.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7CvGnebO0#t=2505.23s
Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b	So we'll come back to the meaning of the pseudo inverse. But now, I want to get real, here, about different situations. So number 1 is the good, normal case, when a person has a square matrix of reasonable size, reasonable condition, a condition number-- oh, the condition number, I should call it sigma 1 over sigma n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_5uLqcwDgM#t=129.31s
Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b	Column pivoting means the columns might not come in a good order, so you allow yourself to reorder them. We know that you have to do that for elimination. In elimination, it would be rows.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_5uLqcwDgM#t=572.92s
Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b	And I wrote inverse problems there, because inverse problem is a type of problem with an application that you often need to solve or that engineering and science have to solve. So I'll just say a little more about that, but that's a typical application in which you're near singular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_5uLqcwDgM#t=741.19s
Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b	You give it an input, and you find the output. You find out what current flows, what the voltages are. But inverse problems are-- suppose you know the response to different voltages.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_5uLqcwDgM#t=826.81s
Lecture 10: Survey of Difficulties with Ax = b	A good one means that when you apply it to the test data that you haven't yet seen, it gives good results on the test data. The solution has learned something from the training data, and it works on the test data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_5uLqcwDgM#t=1351.57s
31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix	The feature vector, the vector that's associated with 1 sample, is enormous. Is enormous. So I have N samples but maybe-- well, if they were in color that million suddenly becomes 3 million.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pFv7e9xtHo#t=318.46s
31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix	You're going to take-- if you have an image, say you have an image with zillions of pixels. Well, you might want to cut down. I mean, it would be very sensible to do some max pooling, some pooling operation to make it smaller.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pFv7e9xtHo#t=608.053s
31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix	Antisymmetric. Big deal, but those are important. So, symmetric means A transpose equals A. Diagonal you know. A transpose equals A inverse for orthogonal matrices. Now, I'm going to put in antisymmetric matrices where A transpose is minus A. What do you think you know about the eigenvalues for antisymmetric matrices? Shall we take a example? Anti symmetric matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pFv7e9xtHo#t=1718.32s
31. Eigenvectors of Circulant Matrices: Fourier Matrix	Because in the end the Q's cancel and you just have 2 diagonal matrices there and that's sort of automatic, that diagonal matrices commute. So, a normal matrix is one that commutes with its transpose.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pFv7e9xtHo#t=2096.98s
9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems	The pseudo inverse is the inverse when there is one. But I'm thinking about cases where either the matrix is rectangular, or it has zero eigenvalues. It could be square, but it has a null space, other than just the 0 vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUU57Q3CFOU#t=424.29s
9. Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems	It's not the identity matrix because if x is in the null space, A plus A will take it to 0. So it's a projection. A plus A is the identity on the top half, and 0 on the bottom half.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUU57Q3CFOU#t=846.47s
Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step	Let me start with that one, and I'll start with Newton's method, Newton's method to solve these n equations and n unknowns. OK, so Newton, Newton's method which is often not presented in 18.02.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvXRJIBOREc#t=659.72s
Lecture 21: Minimizing a Function Step by Step	So first, I'll write down a method that does not involve, so method one, and this will be steepest descent. And what is that? That says that xK plus 1-- the new x is the old x minus-- steepest descent means that I move in the steepest direction which is the direction of the gradient of F.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvXRJIBOREc#t=1442.75s
3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I	Conjecture means you don't have any damn idea of whether it's true or not. Is that divisible by four? Yeah, I guess it would be. 600 certainly is, and 68 certainly is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa2jPbURTjQ#t=1609.34s
3. Orthonormal Columns in Q Give Q'Q = I	And then they're done at high speed by the fast Fourier transform. Those are eigenvectors of Q, eigenvectors of the right Q. So let me just tell you in the right Q that get-- who's eigenvectors-- So here we go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa2jPbURTjQ#t=2182.9s
Lecture 32: ImageNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), The Convolution Rule	So eigenvectors. Eigenvectors of the circulant. Of course, I can only do square matrices. So I'm doing the periodic case. So the eigenvectors are the columns of the eigenvector matrix. And I'm going to call it F for Fourier.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwDRfkPSXng#t=1277.79s
5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices	I'll start on the math then. We had symmetric-- eigenvalues of matrices, and especially symmetric matrices, and those have real eigenvalues, and I'll quickly show why. And orthogonal eigenvectors, and I'll quickly show why.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsP-S7yKaRA#t=168.17s
5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices	You're not going to hit here. And it's going to miss that and come up. Maybe I should draw it over here, whatever. So it's called a line search, to decide how far to go there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsP-S7yKaRA#t=1439.94s
5. Positive Definite and Semidefinite Matrices	OK. OK. Let me introduce the idea of semidefinite. Semidefinite is the borderline. So what did we have? We had 3, 4, 4. And then when it was 5, you told me indefinite, a negative eigenvalue.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsP-S7yKaRA#t=2271.774s
Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values	There are many full-rank matrices-- matrices that don't have any singular values that are zero-- but the singular values decay rapidly to zero. That are full-rank matrices with low numerical rank because of the wiggle room.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BYsNpTCZGg#t=1459.23s
Lecture 17: Rapidly Decreasing Singular Values	So for example, here is the classic matrix that fits this regime. If I give you this, this is called the Hilbert matrix. This is a matrix that happens to have extremely low numerical rank but it's actually full rank, which means that I can approximate H by a rank k matrix where k is quite small very well, provided you give me some wiggle room, but it's not a low-rank matrix in the sense that if epsilon was zero here, you didn't allow me the wriggle room, all the singular values of this matrix are positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BYsNpTCZGg#t=1473.78s
35. Finding Clusters in Graphs	So spectral theory, spectral clustering is using the eigenvalues of some matrix. That's what that spectral is telling me. Yeah. So the spectral theorem, of course, is that for a symmetric matrix S, the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxTmmasBiC8#t=834.19s
35. Finding Clusters in Graphs	And what is it? It tells us which node is connected to which node. So I don't allow nodes-- edges that connect a node to itself, so 0's on the diagonal. How many-- so which nodes are connected to node 1? Well, all of 2 and 4 and 3 are connected to 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxTmmasBiC8#t=1192.6s
35. Finding Clusters in Graphs	This is called the x2-- is the next eigenvector-- is the eigenvector for the smallest positive eigenvalue for a lambda min excluding 0-- so the smallest eigenvalue of L-- the smallest eigenvalue and its eigenvector-- this is called the Fiedler vector, named after the Czech mathematician.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxTmmasBiC8#t=1419.96s
35. Finding Clusters in Graphs	GILBERT STRANG: Orthogonal. These are eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. So they're orthogonal. So that means-- to be orthogonal to this guy means that your components add to 0, right? A Vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxTmmasBiC8#t=1874.845s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	And new ideas came partly from people at MIT. And these two are now still locked in competition. One hasn't beaten the other in all problems. So linear programming is here. But then, for nonlinear programming, quadratic programming, where the cost is quadratic, nonlinear programming, semi-definite programming-- that's where you have a matrix unknown and matrix constraints-- those are all-- the more complicated you get, the more it tends to be interior point methods.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=888.02s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	So maybe I'll put the idea of, first of all, a weak duality. Which says that this quantity that we're trying to maximize-- we're getting it as large as possible-- is always less or equal to any c transpose x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=1071.14s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	OK, good. So the math is right. Everything does its part. And then, of course, the beautiful result, the important result is that there is strong duality, just called duality, which is that at the maximum-- now this is not for any x and y but this is for-- this is going to be for x y star, the winner, and x star, the winner-- equality holds.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=1306.29s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	Maybe 14 is the best possible. So how would we show that 14 is the best possible? I think if I could find-- so this is called a cut, a cut in this network.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=2005.92s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	So this is a case of duality where you can understand duality by the statement that the flow cannot exceed the capacity of the cut. So that's what duality is, that any flow has to be less or equal the capacity of any cut, the capacity being the sum of the ones.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=2242.9s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	So this is not a saddle point. And what do we do? Mixed strategy, which is y will choose the two columns with some probabilities that add to 1. So there will be a third possibility, that p x1 and 1-- I'm sorry-- p y1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=2570.88s
24. Linear Programming and Two-Person Games	A mixed strategy is some combination of strategies, some combination of pure strategies, like choose this column, choose this row. But some columns may not-- or rows-- may not show up in the best mixture.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feb9j65Iz4w#t=3002.04s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	But I'm not allowed to sort it. One solution to this problem, this is the naÔve algorithm, is you just sort and then return the kth element. This is another possible definition of the problem. And we would like to do better than that. So you could sort, what's called the array A, and then return A[k].	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR_RUjsJnV8#t=106.0s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And partition uses that first element to split the rest of the array into less than or equal to that random partition and greater than or equal to that partition. This is just picking a random partition element between p and q, cutting the array in half, although the two sizes may not be equal. And it returns the index of that partition element, some number between p and q.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR_RUjsJnV8#t=390.0s
Lec 6 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	But it can be done. And then we have the three-way branching. So if i happens to equal k we're happy. The pivot element is the element we're looking for, but more likely i is either less than k or it is bigger than k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR_RUjsJnV8#t=3210.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, it works well when the graph is dense. So, the graph is dense if the number of edges is close to all of the edges possible. OK, then this is a good representation. But for many types of graphs, the number of edges is much less than the possible number of edges, in which case we say the graph is sparse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=603.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So therefore, the number of edges would be order V. And in particular, you'd only have one edge per row here. What other graphs are sparse? Yeah? Good, a planar graph, a graph that can be drawn in a plane turns out that if it has V vertices has, and V is at least three, then it has, at most, three V minus six edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=656.026s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Actually, adjacency list of a given vertex is the list, which we denote by Adj of V, of vertices adjacent to V. OK, just in terms by their terminology, vertices are adjacent, but edges are incident on vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=766.625s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, so the incidence is a relation between a vertex and an edge. An adjacency is a relation between two vertices. OK, that's just the language. Why they use to different terms, I don't know, but that's what they do. So, in the graph, for example, the adjacency list for vertex one is just the list or the set of two three because one has going out of one are edges to two and three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=797.028s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	I want the minimum weight. The one that has the overall smallest weight. So, can somebody argue to me that three has to be in there? Yeah? That's the minimum of two, which means that if I had a, if you add something you said was a minimum spanning tree that didn't include three, right, and so therefore it had to include 14, then I could just delete this edge, 14, and put in edge three. And, I have something of lower weight, right? So, three has to be in there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=1840.662s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And that, we call, the hallmark for greedy algorithms. And that is, we have a thing called the greedy choice property, which says that a locally optimal choice is globally optimal. And, of course, as all these hallmarks is the kind of thing you want to box, OK, because these are the clues that you're going to be able to do that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=2885.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, what I want to do, that, is I have a tree here, T, and I have two vertices, u and v, and in a tree, between any two vertices there is a unique, simple path: simple path meaning it doesn't go back and forth and repeat edges or vertices. OK, there's a unique, simple path from u to v. So, let's consider that path.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPEMBWg_WlY#t=3422.0s
Lec 19 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Then we got negative edge weights. Today, the Death Star challenges us with all pair shortest paths, where we want to know the shortest path weight between every pair of vertices. OK, so let's get some quick results.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sygq1e0xWnM#t=270.841s
Lec 12 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Good morning. Today we're going to talk about it a balanced search structure, so a data structure that maintains a dynamic set subject to insertion, deletion, and search called skip lists. So, I'll call this a dynamic search structure because it's a data structure. It supports search, and it's dynamic, meaning insert and delete.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwUoWpeH_Q#t=7.0s
Lec 12 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	You'd have to solve your problem set again, if you don't have it memorized. Skip lists, on the other hand, are a data structure you will never forget, and something you can implement within an hour, no problem. I've made this claim a couple times before, and I always felt bad because I had never actually done it. So, this morning, I implemented skip lists, and it took me ten minutes to implement a linked list, and 30 minutes to implement skip lists. And another 30 minutes debugging them. There you go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwUoWpeH_Q#t=229.012s
Lec 5 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	This is a restriction on algorithms. It is, in some sense, stating what kinds of elements we're dealing with. They are elements that we can somehow compare. They have a total order, some are less, some are bigger.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VqawRl3Xzs#t=325.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	But we need one important property of counting sort before we can go there. And that important property is stability. A stable sorting algorithm preserves the order of equal elements, let's say the relative order.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VqawRl3Xzs#t=2849.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Here I'm spending n lg n time, so that's no good. Instead, what we're going to do is take a bunch of bits and call that a digit, the most bits we can handle with counting sort. The notation will be I split each integer into b/r digits. Each r bits long.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VqawRl3Xzs#t=3996.666s
Lec 14 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, let's just define online. So, a sequence, S, of operations is provided one at a time for each operation. An online algorithm must execute the operation immediately without getting a chance to look at what else is coming in the sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RxCCEHlEys#t=299.285s
Lec 14 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, there is what's called temporal locality, meaning that in time, I tend to access, so it may be that I access some thing's very hot for awhile; then it gets very cold. This type of algorithm responds very well to the hotness of the accessing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RxCCEHlEys#t=1150.0s
Lec 14 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, let's just do an example. So, let's say L_i is the list with five elements. OK, I'll use characters for the order just to keep things simple. So, in this case phi of L_i is going to be twice the cardinality of the set. So what we want to do is see which things are out of order. So here, I look at E and C are in this order, but C and E in that order.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RxCCEHlEys#t=1938.476s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	We only have four more lectures left, and what Professor Demaine and I have decided to do is give two series of lectures on sort of advanced topics. So, today at Wednesday we're going to talk about parallel algorithms, algorithms where you have more than one processor whacking away on your problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=7.0s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And this is a very hot topic right now because all of the chip manufacturers are now producing so-called multicore processors where you have more than one processor per chip. So, knowing something about that is good.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=34.0s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	But what we are going to be mostly talking about is the logical parallelism here, and what we can do in that context. So, in this DAG, the vertices are threads, which are maximal sequences of instructions not containing -- -- parallel control. And by parallel control, I just mean spawn, sync, and return from a spawned procedure. So, let's just mark the, so the vertices are threads. So, let's just mark what the vertices are here, OK, what the threads are here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=547.0s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, so we can look at that as a bunch of small threads. So those of you who are familiar with threads from Java threads, or POSIX threads, OK, so-called P threads, those are sort of heavyweight static threads.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=700.395s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, we define T_1 over T_P to be the speedup on P processors. OK, so we say, how much faster is it on P processors than on one processor? OK, that's the speed up. If T_1 over T_P is order P, we say that it's linear speedup.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=1795.195s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, so you've got to wait until everything is executed. So, a greedy scheduler, what it says is let's just try to do as much as possible on every step, OK? In other words, it says I'm never going to try to guess that it's worthwhile delaying doing something.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=2359.317s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	If I could do something now, I'm going to do it. And so, each step is going to correspond to be one of two types. The first type is what we'll call a complete step. And this is a step in which there are at least P threads ready to run.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=2396.556s
Lec 22 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, it turns out that this type of scheduling problem turns out to be a very difficult problem to get it optimal. But, there's nice theorem, due independently to Graham and Brent. It says, essentially, a greedy scheduler executes any computation, G, with work, T_1, and critical path length, T infinity in time, T_P, less than or equal to T_1 over P plus T infinity -- -- on a computer with P processors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYvJmLKhM-Y#t=2604.153s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, these are non binary trees. Instead of binary, we have maybe binary and tertiary, or maybe binary and tertiary, or quaternary, over a general concept degree, B. So, that's another way you can get balance. Two-three trees, which were the second trees to be invented, they were invented in 1970 by Hopcroft. The trees we will cover today are called red black trees. These are binary search trees of guaranteed logarithmic height.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hI9FdxFOM#t=171.0s
Lec 10 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Then, we looked at ten. Ten was the violator. It was a zigzag case relative to its grandparent. So, we did a right rotation to fix that, took this edge, and turned it so that ten became next to seven.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hI9FdxFOM#t=4610.687s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Tree walk recursively walks the left subtree, then prints out the root, and then recursively walks the right subtree. And, by the binary search tree property, that will print the elements out in sorted order.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgELyZ9LXX4#t=204.0s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	It's going to use a fancy trick, which is exponentiating a random variable. And to do that we need a tool called Jenson's inequality. We are going to prove that tool. Usually, we don't prove probability tools. But this one we are going to prove. It's not too hard.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgELyZ9LXX4#t=1600.0s
Lec 9 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	You should have seen convexity in any calculus class. A convex function is one that looks like this. OK, good. One way to formalize that notion is to consider any two points on this curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgELyZ9LXX4#t=1960.0s
Lec 15 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, we're just going to look at prefixes and we're going to show how we can express the length of the longest common subsequence of prefixes in terms of each other. In particular, we're going to define c of ij to be the length, the longest common subsequence of the prefix of x going from one to i, and y of going to one to j. And what we are going to do is we're going to calculate c[i,j] for all ij.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5hZoJ6uK-s#t=846.0s
Lec 15 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	There is another way to look at it that's kind of what you are expressing there is an amortized, a bookkeeping, way of looking at this. What's the amortized cost? You could say what the amortized cost of calculating one of these, where basically whenever I call it, I'm going to charge a constant amount for looking up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5hZoJ6uK-s#t=3065.0s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Textbook is this book, Introduction to Algorithms. MIT students can get it any of the local bookstores, including the MIT Coop. There is also a new online service that provides textbooks. You can also get a discount if you buy it at the MIT Press Bookstore.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyuH4qXLZ0#t=282.0s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Exams is when we evaluate you. And now we're not interested in evaluating other people, we're interested in evaluating you. So, no collaboration on exams. We will have a take home exam for the second quiz.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyuH4qXLZ0#t=915.0s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And then you'll be in a position to design algorithms that you can analyze and that which are efficient. The analysis of algorithm is the theoretical study -- -- of computer program performance -- -- and resource usage.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyuH4qXLZ0#t=1065.0s
Lec 1 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	"And our output is a permutation of those numbers. A permutation is a rearrangement of the numbers. Every number appears exactly once in the rearrangement such that, I sometimes use a dollar sign to mean ""such that,"" a 1 is less than or equal to a 2 prime."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyuH4qXLZ0#t=1701.142s
Lec 13 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, already it's nicely mathematical. OK, and of course, the costs of operation i remains at c_i. And, now what we are going to do is define the potential function, phi, which maps the set of data structures into the reals. So, associated with every data structure, now, is a potential, OK, a real-valued potential, often integer potential such that phi of D_0 is equal to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh5lSHCBiRs#t=2568.561s
Lec 13 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	OK, charging enough when I do the insert to amortize it against the delete. That you could do with an accounting method. You can also do it with a potential method, the potential, then, being the number of items that I actually have in my data structure times the cost of the delete for each of those items.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh5lSHCBiRs#t=4687.0s
Lec 25 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Once it's filled, that means everything has been pulled up, and then it's merged. OK, so that's how we get started. So, merge means to merge algorithm is fill the topmost buffer, the topmost output buffer. OK, and now, here's how you fill a buffer. So, in general, if you expand out this recursion all the way, in the base case, I didn't mention you sort of get a little node there. So, if you look at an arbitrary buffer in this picture that you want to fill, so this one's empty and you want to fill it, then immediately below it will be a vertex who has two children, two other buffers. OK, maybe they look like this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjUDy6a5vx4#t=3761.542s
Lec 3 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And there is no class on Monday. It is the holiday known as Student Holiday, so don't come. Today we are going to cover something called Divide and Conquer. Also known as divide and rule or divide et impera for those of you who know Latin, which is a tried and tested way of conquering a land by dividing it into sections of some kind.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EQTVuAhSFY#t=67.0s
Lec 3 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	As you might expect, the first step in divide-and-conquer is divide and the second step is conquer. But you may not have guessed that there are three steps. And I am leaving some blank space here, so you should, too. Divide-and-conquer is an algorithmic technique. You are given some big problem you want to solve, you don't really know how to solve it in an efficient way, so you are going to split it up into subproblems. That is the divide.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EQTVuAhSFY#t=169.0s
Lec 3 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	You took the prerequisites. OK. I just want to phrase it as a divide-and-conquer because you don't normally see it that way. The divide step is you compare X with the middle element in your array.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EQTVuAhSFY#t=639.0s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So these, whenever you have a set operations, where operations that change the set like in certain delete, we call it a dynamic set. So these two operations make the set dynamic. It changes over time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZHBa-rLrBA#t=220.0s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Because most of the table would be empty for any reasonable set of values you would want to keep. So the idea is we want to try to keep something that's going to keep the table small, while still preserving some of the properties. And that's where hashing comes in. So hashing is we use a hash function H which maps the keys randomly.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZHBa-rLrBA#t=564.427s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So alpha is the average number of keys per, we call it the load factor of the table. OK. How many on average keys do I have? So the expected, we'll look first at unsuccessful search time. So by unsuccessful search, I mean I'm looking for something that's actually not in the table. It's going to return nil.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZHBa-rLrBA#t=1378.0s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, it suffers from primary clustering, where regions of the hash table get very full. And then, anything that hashes into that region has to look through all the stuff that's there. OK, so: long runs of filled slots. OK, there's also things like quadratic clustering, where you basically make this be, instead of adding one each time, you add i each time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZHBa-rLrBA#t=3645.258s
Lec 7 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	It's got some nice math in it. So, once again, in the worst case, hashing is lousy. So, we're going to analyze average case. OK, and for this, we need a little bit stronger assumption than for chaining. And, we call it the assumption of uniform hashing, which says that each key is equally likely, OK, to have any one of the m factorial permutations as its probe sequence, independent of other keys.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZHBa-rLrBA#t=3849.0s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Rather than being given all the data upfront, we're going to have a set. And then at some point somebody is going to be doing typically insert and delete. And at some point somebody is going to say OK, select for me the ith largest guy or the ith smallest guy -- -- in the dynamic set. Or, something like OS-Rank of x. The rank of x in the sorted order of the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHyGlha7bjE#t=131.0s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Good. But what is the meaning of k? The order. The rank. Good, the rank of the current node. This is the rank of the current node. k is always the size of the left subtree plus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHyGlha7bjE#t=830.0s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	For example, if we actually kept the ranks in the nodes, certainly it would be easy to find the element of a given rank. But all I have to do is insert the smallest element, an element that is smaller than all of the other elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHyGlha7bjE#t=1124.0s
Lec 11 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And we're going to have a query, which is going to be the new operation we're going to develop, which is going to be to find an interval, any interval in the set that overlaps a given query interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHyGlha7bjE#t=2381.0s
Lec 17 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	So, this is just a real number on each edge. So, edge weights are usually given by function, w. For every edge, you get a real number. And then, if we look at the paths in the graph, so we're going to use some simple notation for paths called a path, p, starts at some vertex, and it goes to some other vertex, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhG2DyCX3uA#t=132.633s
Lec 17 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	In this class, we mainly worry about the weights because it's pretty much the same problem. The shortest path tree is the union of all shortest paths. And in particular, if you look at each vertex in your graph, if you consider the last edge into that vertex that was relaxed among all vertices, u, you look at the edges, (u,v), say, was that last one to relax? So, just look at the last edges we relaxed here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhG2DyCX3uA#t=2626.015s
Lec 24 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Now, what I want to do is count memory transfers. These are transfers of blocks, so I should say block memory transfers between the two levels, so, between the cache and main memory. So, memory transfers are either reading reads or writes. Maybe I should say that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJOHERGcGm4#t=1179.98s
Lec 24 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	That's a cache aware algorithm. OK, we're not too interested in cache aware algorithms. We've seen one, B trees. B trees are cache aware data structure. You assume that there is some block size, B, underlying.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJOHERGcGm4#t=1321.585s
Lec 24 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And therefore, the whole performance is good. Good here means asymptotically optimal up to constant factors, something like that. OK, so I don't want to prove that, and you can read the cache oblivious papers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJOHERGcGm4#t=1908.577s
Lec 24 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	Usually polynomial means you have an integer power. Let's call it a polynomial. Why not? There's a lot of leaves, is the point, and if we say that each leaf costs a constant number of memory transfers, we're in trouble because then the number of memory transfers has to be at least this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJOHERGcGm4#t=3334.0s
Lec 18 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	And we triumphed over the Empire by designing Dijkstra's algorithm, and very efficiently finding single source shortest paths, shortest path weight from s to every other vertex. Today, however, the Death Star has a new trick up its sleeve, and we have negative weights, potentially. And we're going to have to somehow deal with, in particular, negative weight cycles. And we saw that when we have a negative weight cycle, we can just keep going around, and around, and around, and go back in time farther, and farther, and farther.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttezuzs39nk#t=46.221s
Lec 18 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	A system of different constraints is a linear feasibility problem. So, it's an LP where there's no objective. And, it's with a restriction, so, where each row of the matrix, so, the matrix, A, has one one, and it has one minus one, and everything else in the row is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttezuzs39nk#t=2865.743s
Lec 18 | MIT 6.046J / 18.410J Introduction to Algorithms (SMA 5503), Fall 2005	It cooks, it cleans, it finds shortest paths. It also minimizes the spread, the maximum over all i of x_i minus the minimum over all i of x_i. So, I mean, if you have your real line, and here are the x_i's wherever they are. It minimizes this distance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttezuzs39nk#t=4280.393s
9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)	And that's why rather than calling this guy s sub 1 minus alpha all the time, I write it q alpha. So now you have this q alpha, which is the 1 minus alpha quintile, or quintile of order 1 minus alpha of chi squared d.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkOaifVfW4#t=2515.0s
9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)	And so there's this weird geometry that shows up. There is actually an entire field, admittedly a bit dormant these days, that's called information geometry, and it's really doing differential geometry on spaces that are defined by Fisher information matrices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkOaifVfW4#t=2905.8s
9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)	It's actually here, the r dimensional linear space of vectors, that have the first r coordinates that can move and the last coordinates that are fixed to some number. Actually, it's undefined space because it doesn't necessarily go through zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkOaifVfW4#t=4003.04s
9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)	And now I can actually just say, OK, if I know this about theta, I can apply the multivariate delta method, which tells me that square root of n, g of theta hat, minus g of theta goes in distribution to some n0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkOaifVfW4#t=4349.16s
9. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)	And that's exactly what we've been doing before. When we introduced tests in the first place, we just took absolute values, said, well, is the absolute value of a Gaussian in the limit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkOaifVfW4#t=4827.39s
12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)	And sigma squared to be sigma squared hat to be, well, Sn hat-- Sn-- what we wrote Sn, which is 1/n sum from i equal 1 to n of xi minus xn bar squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMaKx9fmJHE#t=203.72s
12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)	So phi mu hat sigma hat squared-- sorry, sigma hat squared-- is the CDF of some Gaussian with mean mu hat and variance sigma hat squared. And so in particular, this thing here, phi hat of mu hat-- sorry, phi hat of mu hat sigma hat squared of t is the probability that some x is less than t, where x follows some N mu hat sigma hat squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMaKx9fmJHE#t=362.21s
12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)	And those are what's called quantile-quantile plots, and in particular-- or QQ plots. And the basic QQ plots we're going to be using are the ones that are called normal QQ plots that are comparing your data to a Gaussian distribution, or a normal distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMaKx9fmJHE#t=1728.35s
12. Testing Goodness of Fit (cont.)	Those are sometimes referred to as theoretical quantiles, the one we're trying to test, and empirical quantiles, the one that corresponds to the empirical CDF. And so I'm plotting a plot where the x-axis is quantile.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMaKx9fmJHE#t=2130.42s
19. Principal Component Analysis	And superscripts, the indices that correspond to coordinates of a variable. And I think that's the same convention that we took for the regression case. Of course, you could use whatever you want.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW3ZJHPwvyg#t=357.17s
19. Principal Component Analysis	And if you have not, then that's something you just need to get comfortable with, right? So one thing that's going to be useful is to know very quickly what's called the outer product of a vector with itself, which is the vector of times the vector transpose, what the entries of these things are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW3ZJHPwvyg#t=765.4s
19. Principal Component Analysis	This is the second definition of covariance. Just like you have the variance which is the expectation of the square of X minus c of X, or the expectation X squared minus the expectation of X squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW3ZJHPwvyg#t=830.85s
19. Principal Component Analysis	So this thing is actually 0. So let me repeat my question. Onto what subspace does H project? Onto the subspace of vectors that have mean 0. A vector that has mean 0 is a vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW3ZJHPwvyg#t=2527.23s
19. Principal Component Analysis	But hopefully, the variance is going to spread things out nicely. So the idea of principal component analysis is going to try to identify those variances-- those directions along which we have a lot of variance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW3ZJHPwvyg#t=3217.18s
19. Principal Component Analysis	And sigma is going to tell you which direction it's elongated. And so in particular, if you look, if you knew an ellipse, you know there's something called principal axis, right? So you could actually define something that looks like this, which is this axis, the one along which it's the most elongated.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW3ZJHPwvyg#t=3929.24s
6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments	It's not going to blow up much. But if the condition number is very large, it's just going to blow up a lot. And the condition number is the ratio of the largest and the smallest eigenvalues.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTbZP0yt9qc#t=3664.34s
6. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.) and the Method of Moments	And there is something called the multivariate delta method, where derivatives are replaced by gradients. Like, they always are in multivariate calculus. And rather than multiplying, since things do not compute, rather than choosing which side I want to put the square, I'm actually just going to take half of the square on one side and the other half of the square on the other side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTbZP0yt9qc#t=4526.23s
24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	If the covariance matrix is any matrix you have another solution, which involves the inverse of the covariance matrix that you have, but if your covariance matrix, in particular, is diagonal-- which would mean that each observation that you get in this system of equations is still independent, but the variances can change from one line to another, from one observation to another-- then it's called heteroscedastic.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWW54ts9Ubo#t=1813.6s
24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	"""Hetero"" means ""not the same."" ""Scedastic"" is ""scale."" And a heteroscedastic case, you would have something slightly different. And it makes sense that, if you know that some observations have much less variance than others, you might want to give them more weight."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWW54ts9Ubo#t=1837.57s
24. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	It's called an oracle sometimes. An oracle is what you assume the machine can do easily for you. So if you assume that your machine is very good at multiplying by the inverse of a matrix, you might as well just do Fisher scoring yourself, right? It's just a way so that you don't have to actually do it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWW54ts9Ubo#t=3089.0s
5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)	And for that, you need to remind yourself of Calculus II, and you have generalization of the notion of derivative, which is called a gradient, which is basically a vector where each coordinate is just the partial derivative with respect to each coordinate of theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Va2dOLqUfM#t=1594.64s
5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cont.)	Because in practice, it just doesn't happen. So the Fisher information is the expectation of the-- that's called the outer product. So that's the product of this gradient and the gradient transpose.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Va2dOLqUfM#t=4364.08s
22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	So today, we're going to talk about likelihood, and we're going to start with the likelihood function or the log likelihood for one observation. From this, we're going to do some computations, and then, we'll move on to the actual log likelihood based on n independent observations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc1y8m9-hOM#t=194.59s
22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	We would just want to take the identity. The problem is that if I start having the identity that goes here, it's going to start being a problem. And this is the probit link, the phi verse that you see here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc1y8m9-hOM#t=2751.134s
22. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	And we'll see that this can be, actually, implemented using what's called iteratively re-weighted least squares, which means that every step-- since it's just a quadratic, it's going to be just squares in there-- can actually be solved by using a weighted least squares version of the problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc1y8m9-hOM#t=4541.06s
2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)	And so it's essentially telling me that, well, rather than actually looking at all bounded and continuous but real functions, I can actually look at one specific family of complex functions, which are the functions that maps T to E to the ixT for x and R. That's a much smaller family of functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_W1adH-NVE#t=2032.68s
2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)	Why a Gaussian? Why does it kick in? Well, because what is the characteristic function of a Gaussian? Does anybody remember the characteristic function of a standard Gaussian? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, well, I mean there's two pi's and stuff that goes away, right? A Gaussian is a random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_W1adH-NVE#t=2113.82s
2. Introduction to Statistics (cont.)	There's something that is waiting for us at the end of his lecture, which is called Slutsky's that says that if V, in this case, converges in probability but U converge in distribution, I can actually still do that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_W1adH-NVE#t=2544.95s
1. Introduction to Statistics	And so they just run all these studies. And at some point, one will be right just out of chance. And so we have to be very careful about doing this. There's much more complicated problems associated to what's called p-hacking, which consists of violating the basic assumptions, in particular, looking at the data, and then formulating your scientific assumption based on data, and then going back to it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0#t=1121.92s
1. Introduction to Statistics	Based on what they've seen, maybe they have chances of seeing something which is even larger than everything they've seen before. And that's exactly the goal of statistical modeling-- being able to extrapolate beyond the data that you have, guessing what you have not seen yet might happen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0#t=1250.08s
1. Introduction to Statistics	You will recognize me without having to do a biopsy on me every time you see me. All right, so, to understand randomness you have to go through probability. Probability is the study of randomness.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0#t=1659.1s
1. Introduction to Statistics	The words you will hear a lot are IID-- independent and identically distributed-- that means that your data is basically all the sams. And one data point is not impacting another data point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0#t=2655.65s
1. Introduction to Statistics	An estimate is the realization of a random variable, or, in other words, is the value that you get for this random variable once you plug in the numbers that you've collected.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0#t=3769.33s
1. Introduction to Statistics	OK, and I can do it, and it's 67.5. This is my estimate. Now if I want to compute a standard deviation-- so let's say estimate for sigma. You've seen that before, right? An estimate for sigma is what? An estimate for sigma, we'll see methods to do this, but sigma squared is the variance, or is the expectation, of x minus expectation of x squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0#t=4374.32s
18. Bayesian Statistics (cont.)	And so another prior that you can think of, in the case where you have a Fisher information, which is well-defined, is something called Jefferys prior. And this prior is a prior which is proportional to square root of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2inA31Gups#t=74.83s
21. Generalized Linear Models	And the mean is affected in a very specific way, which is linear in x, right? So this is essentially the things we're going to try to relax. So the first thing that we assume, the fact that y was Gaussian and had only its mean [INAUDIBLE] dependant no x is what's called the random component.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=228.81s
21. Generalized Linear Models	And the name of g is the link function. So if I want to give you a generalized linear model, I need to give you two ingredients. The first one is the random component, which is the distribution of y given x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=621.66s
21. Generalized Linear Models	Each of your reservation is a time stamp-- say, I don't know, 20th day. And your response is the number of new cases. And you're going to actually put your model directly on mu, right? When I looked at this, everything here was on mu itself, on the expected, right? Mu of x is always the expected-- the conditional expectation of y given x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=916.19s
21. Generalized Linear Models	So there's some distributions that just come up but sometimes just have to work. Now here what do we have? The thing we're trying to measure, y-- as we said, so mu is the expectation, the conditional expectation, of y given x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=1179.909s
21. Generalized Linear Models	So I need to make this transformation. So what I need to do is to transform mu, which is, we know only a number. All we know is a number between 0 and 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=1658.59s
21. Generalized Linear Models	The chi-square is actually part of this family. The beta distribution is part of this family. The binomial distribution is part of this family. Well, that's easy because the Bernoulli was. The negative binomial, which is some stopping time-- the first time you hit a certain number of successes when you flip some Bernoulli coins.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=3386.64s
21. Generalized Linear Models	So now I have to understand two things. I have to understand what is the expectation, right? Because that's actually what I model, right? I take the expectation, the conditional expectation, of y given x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=3554.726s
21. Generalized Linear Models	The mean and the variance are also known as moments. b is called cumulant generating function. So it sounds like moments being related to cumulance, I might have a path to finding those, right? And it might involve taking derivatives of b, as we'll see.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ix97pw0xY#t=4277.53s
11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit	I don't know if I mentioned it last time, but there's this entire field that uses-- you know, for people who really aspire to differential geometry but are stuck in the stats department, and there's this thing called information geometry, which is essentially studying the manifolds associated to the Fisher information metric, the metric that's associated to Fisher information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66tfLdr6oY#t=392.462s
11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit	We'll see actually a particular example. All right, so this theory of testing whether data comes from a particular distribution is called goodness of fit. Is this distribution a good fit for my data? That's the goodness of fit test.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66tfLdr6oY#t=1337.58s
11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit	The p-value is the probability that you have more evidence against your null than what you already have. OK, so now I can write it in terms of cumulative distribution functions. So this is what? This is phi of this guy, which is minus this thing here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66tfLdr6oY#t=1557.685s
11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit	A stochastic process is just a sequence in random variables that's indexed by, let's say time. The one that's the most famous is Brownian motion, and it's basically a bunch of Gaussian increments.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66tfLdr6oY#t=3011.46s
11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit	And that means that only one observation. Everybody sees that? The farthest points, the points at which those two curves are the farthest from each other, has to be at one of the observations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66tfLdr6oY#t=4222.54s
11. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.) and Testing Goodness of Fit	And there's are some, I forget the name, it's Kiefer-Wolfowitz, the Kiefer-Dvoretzky-Wolfowitz, an equality which is basically like Hoeffding's inequality. So it's basically up to bad constants telling you the same result as the Brownian bridge result, and those are true all the time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66tfLdr6oY#t=4910.25s
14. Regression (cont.)	The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix. And I still had something else. I'm sorry, this was sigma squared. I forget it all the time. So the sigma squared comes out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBIz7UadY5M#t=3402.74s
14. Regression (cont.)	That is just the projection matrix onto the orthogonal-- projection onto orthogonal of column span of x. Orthogonal means the set of vectors that's orthogonal to everyone in this linear space. So now, when I'm doing this, this is exactly what-- I mean, in a way, this is illustrating this Pythagoras theorem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBIz7UadY5M#t=3664.46s
14. Regression (cont.)	The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So that means that the trace is going to be an integer number as the number of non-0 eigenvalues. And the non-0 eigenvalues are just the dimension of the space onto which I'm projecting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBIz7UadY5M#t=3954.21s
14. Regression (cont.)	So square root of standard Gaussians-- sorry, with a sigma squared somewhere. And basically, how many am I summing? Well, the n minus p, the number of non-0 eigenvalues of p prime.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBIz7UadY5M#t=4302.05s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	So remember, given those guys, we can form something which is called S, which is the sample, or the empirical covariance matrix. And since from couple of slides ago, we know that S has a eigenvalue decomposition, S is equal to PDP transpose, where P is orthogonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=242.69s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	Whereas, here, I was talking about the empirical variance. So the true variance is the eigenvectors of the true sigma associated to the largest eigenvalue of sigma. So I did not give it a name.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=1240.204s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	One was statistics. Statistics says, if you won't spread, if you want information, you should be looking at variance. The second one was optimization. Optimization said, well, if you want to maximize spread, well, you have to maximize variance in a certain direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=2190.89s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	And so when n is much larger than d, things go well. But if d is less than n, it's not clear what happens. And particularly, if d is of the order of n, what's happening? So there's an entire theory in mathematics that's called random matrix theory that studies the behavior of exactly this question-- what is the behavior of the spectrum-- the eigenvalues and eigenvectors-- of a matrix in which I put random numbers and I let-- so the matrix I'm interested in here is the matrix of X's.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=3410.28s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	But you're looking, maybe, for a special direction. And that's what sparse PCA is doing. Sparse PCA is saying, I'm not looking for any direction new that carries the most variance. I'm only looking for a direction new that is sparse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=3700.61s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	Sparse PCA says, listen, I'm going to want to have at most 10 non-zero coefficients. And the rest, I want to be 0. I want to be able to be a combination of at most 10 of my original variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=3876.78s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	That's a statistical software. And this is an output that was preprocessed by a professional-- not preprocessed, post-processed. So that's something where they read PCA. So what is the data? This is raw data about you ask doctors what they think of the behavior of a particular sales representative for pharmaceutical companies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=4046.69s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	And then if you have, for example, two communities in there, it should look like something that is low rank plus some noise. And low rank means that there's just very few non-zero-- well, low rank means this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=4571.16s
20. Principal Component Analysis (cont.)	Low rank means that if you do the scree plot, you will see something like this, which means that if you throw out all the smaller ones, it should not really matter in the overall structure.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZCeFpeW0o#t=4584.226s
13. Regression	So when this happens, this is called univariate regression. And when x is in rp for p larger than or equal to 2, this is called multivariate regression. OK, and so here we're just trying to explain y is a plus bx plus epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP1S37BiEsQ#t=289.94s
13. Regression	And the way I do this is as follows. Let's define x tilde, which is x minus the expectation of x. OK, so definitely the expectation of x tilde is what? Zero, OK.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP1S37BiEsQ#t=1522.44s
3. Parametric Inference	Statistics means looking at the global averaging thing so that I can actually get a sense of what the global behavior is for the population, right? If I start assuming that those things are not identically distributed-- they all live on their own-- that my sequence of number is your number of siblings-- the shoe size of this person-- the depth of the Charles River, and I start measuring a bunch of stuff.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=191.35s
3. Parametric Inference	You have-- I don't know-- a truncated-- and that's the name I just came up with. But it's actually not exactly describing what I want. But let's say I observe y, which is the indicator of x larger than say 5 when x follows some exponential with parameter lambda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=2502.71s
3. Parametric Inference	The first thing I want to check is maybe if in average, right? So this is a random variable. Is this random variable in average going to be close to theta or not? And so the difference how far I am from theta is actually called the bias.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=4264.45s
3. Parametric Inference	So the bias of an estimator is the expectation of theta hat minus the value that I hope it gets, which is theta. If this thing is equal to 0, we say that theta hat is unbiased.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=4280.14s
3. Parametric Inference	And unbiased estimators are things that people are looking for in general. The problem is that there's lots of unbiased estimators. And so it might be misleading to look for unbiasedness when that's not really the only thing you should be looking for.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=4302.03s
3. Parametric Inference	And so if you want to start having fluctuations coming into the picture, we actually have to look at the risk or the quadratic risk of the estimator. And so the quadratic risk is the finest-- the expectation of the square distance between theta hat and theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=4456.261s
3. Parametric Inference	PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: The law of large numbers, right? Actually, it's strongly consistent if you have a strong [INAUDIBLE].. OK, so just in the last two minutes, I want to tell you a little bit about how this risk is linked to see, quadratic risk is equal to bias squared plus the variance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSkDZbGS94k#t=4645.21s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	Theta is a subset of the real line, and that's why I talk about intervals. An interval is a subset of the line. If I had a subset of R2, for example, that would no longer be called an interval, but a region, just because-- well, that's just we can say a set, a confidence set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=1122.05s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	It takes value 1 minus alpha for some positive alpha. And so the confidence level-- the level of the confidence interval is between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 it is, the better the confidence interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=1158.12s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	That was one of the properties that we wanted. Strongly consistent means that as n goes to infinity, it converges almost surely to the true parameter. That's the strong law of large number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=1415.2s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	So remember, we have a model on a sample space E and some candidate distributions P theta. And really, your goal is to estimate a true theta star, the one that generated some data, X1 to Xn, in an iid fashion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=2088.87s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	This is the function that tells me for each possible value that it can take, the probability that it takes this value. So the Probability Mass Function, PMF, is just the function for all x in the sample space tells me the probability that my random variable is equal to this little value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=2497.98s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	Actually, typically we will assume that they are positive. Otherwise, we can just remove this x from the sample space. And so then I have the total variation distance, I mean, it's supposed to be the maximum overall sets of-- of subsets of E, such that the probability of A minus probability of theta prime of A-- it's complicated, but really there's this beautiful formula that tells me that if I look at the total variation between P theta and P theta prime, it's actually equal to just 1/2 of the sum for all X in E of the absolute difference between P theta X and P theta prime of X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=2540.46s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	It doesn't have to integrate-- it doesn't have to be non-negative. But it certainly has to integrate to 0. And so now I take this thing. And the A star, what is the set A star here? The set A star is the set over which the function delta is non-negative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=3486.836s
4. Parametric Inference (cont.) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation	So that's just the definition. A star was the set over which f minus g was positive, and f minus g was just called delta. So what it means is that what I'm really integrating is delta on this set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLlZpnT02ZU#t=3516.34s
15. Regression (cont.)	And that's something you use when you have what's called-- another key word here is multiple testing, when you're trying to do multiple tests simultaneously. And if s is not of p, well, you just divide by the number of tests that you are actually making.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4xOdtqic3o#t=2552.16s
17. Bayesian Statistics	The Bayesian approach is a tool to one, include mathematically our prior. And our prior belief into statistical procedures. Maybe I have this prior knowledge. But if I'm a medical doctor, it's not clear to me how I'm going to turn this into some principal way of building estimators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZ-0FH5hfs#t=594.6s
17. Bayesian Statistics	So that's just the joint distribution of my Gaussian with mean data. And the another question is, what is the posterior distribution? Well here I said, let's use the uninformative prior, which is an improper prior.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZ-0FH5hfs#t=3789.579s
17. Bayesian Statistics	Which is, in a way, a desirable property. Jeffrey's prior is just an uninformative priors, or priors you want to use when you want a systematic way without really thinking about what to pick for your mile.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZ-0FH5hfs#t=4632.82s
8. Parametric Hypothesis Testing (cont.)	So we define the power, which was some sort of a lower bound on the-- or it's 1 minus the upper bound on the type II error, basically. And so it's alternative-- so the power is the smallest probability of rejecting when you're in the null.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HRhg4eUiMo#t=1218.65s
23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	It's just one particular aspect of this conventional distribution. It's the conditional expectation of Yi given Xi. OK. And so this conditional expectation, I will denote it by-- so I talk about the conditional, I'm going to call it, say, mu i, which is the conditional expectation of Yi given Xi equals some little xi, say.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYcdw5vOgIc#t=284.675s
23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	But depending on what the function is, I would actually need some algorithms that may be working better on some functions than others. Now, here I don't have random things. I have the b is the cumulant generating function of a canonical exponential family.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYcdw5vOgIc#t=1463.04s
23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	And those are called Newton iterations. And they're basically the workhorse of interior point methods, for example, a lot of optimization algorithms. And that's what you can see here. x* is equal to x0 minus the inverse Hessian times the gradient.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYcdw5vOgIc#t=2210.16s
23. Generalized Linear Models (cont.)	OK. And it converges at an extremely fast rate. Usually it's quadratic convergence, which means that every time you make one step, you improve the accuracy of your solution by two digits.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYcdw5vOgIc#t=2441.12s
7. Parametric Hypothesis Testing	OK. So beta psi of theta is the probability under theta that psi is equal to 0, right? That's the probability in theta 1, which means then the alternative, that they feel to reject.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phbw9r1iUDI#t=4322.7s
Lec 29 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And the method I used last time was to describe something called a fundamental matrix. A fundamental matrix for the system or for A, whichever you want, remember what that was. That was a two-by-two matrix of functions of t and whose columns were two independent solutions, x1, x2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zreI4HllD80#t=57.0s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	It only has a slope at each point. It doesn't have any magnitude or direction. It has the direction, but it doesn't have direction in the sense of an arrow telling me whether it is going this way or the opposite way. That is the picture with t in it. These are the corresponding degeneration of that. It is a coarsening, it's a cheapening of it. It is throwing away information. Throw away all the information that had to do with t, and we are back in the first days of the terms with a single first order equations involving only x and y with solutions that involve only x and y with curves that are the graphs of these solutions but again have no t in them. In effect, they are just the paths of the trajectories. Whereas, the trajectory is the point that shows actually how the point is moving along in time faster or slower at various points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR9EVzr4lc#t=552.0s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	But, if I do that, I change the geometric type. In other words, being a borderline, a slight change of the parameters can change what it changes to. And, in fact, that is geometrically clear. What does a center look like? A center looks like this, a bunch of curves going around all in the same direction, like concentric circles or maybe ellipses or something like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR9EVzr4lc#t=1714.0s
Lec 33 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Take the derivative, find out where the maximum point is and you will find, perhaps you have already done it, this is at one. The maximum occurs at one, that is where the derivative is zero and the value there is one times e to the minus one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRR9EVzr4lc#t=2254.0s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	You have a tank, a room, I don't know, where everything's getting mixed in. It has a certain volume, which I will call v. Something is flowing in, a gas or a liquid.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzfsfBNJIw#t=1581.031s
Lec 8 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This is the diffusion model, where salt solution outside, cell in the middle, salt diffusing through a semi-permeable membrane into that, uses Newton's law of diffusion, except he didn't do a law of diffusion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzfsfBNJIw#t=2030.308s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	In general, there are not analytic formulas for the solutions to nonlinear systems like that. There are only computer-drawn things. But sometimes you have to get qualitative information, a quick idea of how the trajectories look.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJG0f0BSX14#t=120.0s
Lec 31 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Now, what would they be? They are the solutions that consist of a single point. How could a solution be a single point? Well, like the origin for a linear system, those points which form solutions all by themselves are called the critical points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJG0f0BSX14#t=811.637s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Remember, I called the unit box function the thing which was one between zero and h and zero everywhere else. The notation we used for that was u, and then it had a double subscript from the starting point and the finishing point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peYvLk_HZdw#t=349.993s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	That is the unit step function, which goes up by one and tries to stay at one ever after. And then, when it gets to h, it has got to step down. Well, the way you make it step down is by subtracting off the function, which is the unit step function but where the step takes place, not at time zero but at time h. In other words, I translate the unit step function of course with, I don't think I have to draw that picture again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peYvLk_HZdw#t=436.208s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Or that pendulum, a damped pendulum, anything that is modeled by that differential equation with constant coefficients, second-order. This is the input. The input can be any kind of a function. Exponential functions, sine, cosine. It could be a Dirac delta function. It could be a sum of these things. It could be a Fourier series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peYvLk_HZdw#t=2220.0s
Lec 23 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	That is the simplest interpretation I know of what this magic weight function is, which gives the solution to all the differential equations, no matter what the input is. The weight function is the response of the system at rest to a sharp kick at time zero with unit impulse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peYvLk_HZdw#t=2649.283s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This is a square matrix. This is what is called a matrix differential equation where the variable is not a single x or a column vector of a set of x's like the x and the y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuTN8rpe4I#t=920.114s
Lec 28 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The method says look for a solution of that form. The variation parameters, these are the parameters that are now varying instead of being constants. Now, if you take it in that form and start trying to substitute into the equation you are going to get a mess.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuTN8rpe4I#t=2222.0s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	But, before that, I'd like to begin by clearing up a couple of questions almost everybody has at some point or other when they study the case of complex roots. Complex roots are the case which produce oscillations in the solutions. That's the relation, and that's why I'm talking about this for the first few minutes. Now, what is the problem? The complex roots, of course, there will be two roots, and they occur at the complex conjugates of each other. So, they will be of the form a plus or minus bi. Last time, I showed you, I took the root r equals a plus bi, which leads to the solution. The corresponding solution is a complex solution which is e to the at, (a plus i b)t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7HEE8-OfA#t=81.621s
Lec 10 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I remember very well from Friday to Monday, but I can't expect you to for a variety of reasons. I mean, I have to think about this stuff all weekend. And you, God forbid. So, here's the picture, and I won't explain anymore what's in it, except there's the mass. Here is the spring constant, the spring with its constant here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7HEE8-OfA#t=1419.692s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	"And, the condition is universally said this way, should be of exponential type. So, what I'm defining is the phrase ""exponential type."" I'll put it in quotation marks for that reason. What does this mean? It's a condition, a growth condition on a function, says how fast it can get big."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=196.286s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	We need more formulas. So, I'll put them, why don't I save this board, and instead, I'll describe to you the basic way Laplace transforms are used to solve differential equations, what are they called, a paradigm. I'll show you the paradigm, and then we'll fill in the holes so you have some overall view of how the procedure goes, and then you'll understand where the various pieces fit into it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=917.141s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And, the answer will always come out to be Y equals, Y of s equals some rational function, some quotient of polynomials in s, a polynomial in s divided by some other polynomial in s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=1185.445s
Lec 20 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	What you would do instead is-- How are we going to fill that in? Well, a second derivative is also a first derivative. A second derivative is the first derivative of the first derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZHseRxAWZ8#t=1905.205s
Lec 9 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	A stiff spring, one that pulls with hard force is going to make that thing go back and forth, particularly at the dipping is weak. So, let's use almost the same equation as I've just concealed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP-oRQqmeg4#t=2156.38s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	"And we have so far two basic methods of solving it. The first one, on which we spent the most time, is the method of where you calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix, the eigenvectors, and put them together to make the general solution. So eigenvalues, e-vectors and so on. The second method, which I gave you last time, I called ""royal road,"" simply calculates the matrix e to the At and says that the solution is e to the At times x zero, the initial condition. That is very elegant."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=36.0s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Coupled means that the x and y occur in both equations on the right-hand side. And, therefore, you cannot solve separately for x and y, you must solve together for both of them. Here I can solve separately for u and v and, therefore, the system has been decoupled.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=360.0s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Sometimes it is called the two compartment ice cube tray problem, a very old-fashion type of ice cube tray. Not a modern one that is all plastic where there is no leaking from one compartment to another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=452.0s
Lec 30 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Or, you rotate it. That's okay, too. And the matrix defines a linear transformation to the plane, every vector goes to another vector. The question it asks is, is there a vector which is taken by this linear transformation and just left alone or stretched, is kept in the same direction but stretched? Or, maybe its direction is reversed and it is stretched or it shrunk. But, in general, if there are real eigenvalues there will be such vectors that are just left in the same direction but just stretched or shrunk. And what is the lambda? The lambda then is the amount by which they are stretched or shrunk, the factor. This way, first we have to find the vector, which is left essentially unchanged, and then the number here that goes with it is the stretching factor or the shrinking factor. But the end result is the pair alpha one and lambda one, regardless of which order you find them, satisfied the same equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOyxQwIV8o#t=2042.0s
Lec 26 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	It is circular table. Everyone is dying equally. Everybody can get input from the other two cells. x1 prime is some constant of conductivity times the temperature difference between tank three and tank one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtWqTPPXuc#t=334.0s
Lec 26 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	A defective eigenvalue is one where you can get one eigenvector. If it is double, for example, if it a double eigenvalue. It is defective if you can get one eigenvector that goes with it, but you cannot find an independent one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtWqTPPXuc#t=1830.0s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And therefore, it's okay to separate the two integrals out that way because I'm integrating sort of a rectangle that goes to infinity that way and infinity that way. But, what I'm integrating is over the plane, in other words, this region of the plane as u, v goes from zero to infinity, zero to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ejfkMHr_DE#t=1122.0s
Lec 21 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Let's say t is in years. You like to have units, and quantity, kilograms, I don't know, whatever you want. Now, what does the dumping rate mean? The dumping rate means that if I have two times that are close together, for example, two successive days, midnight on two successive days, then there's a time interval between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ejfkMHr_DE#t=1803.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And therefore, the final result is that our Fourier series, the Fourier series for f of t, that funny function is, the Fourier series is summation bn, which is two, put the two out front because it's in every term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWa5_OXI6VM#t=1415.0s
Lec 16 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Taylor series concentrates at this point, does it the best it can at this point. Then it tries, with the next term, to do a little better, and then a little better. The whole philosophy is entirely different. Taylor series are used for analyzing what a function of looks like which you stick close to the base point. Fourier series analyze what a function looks like over the whole interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWa5_OXI6VM#t=1600.421s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	From the point of view of the field they are where the field is zero. There is no velocity vector, in other words. The velocity vector is zero. And, therefore, a point being there has no reason to go anywhere else. And, spelling it out, it's where the partial derivatives, where the values of the functions on the right-hand side, which give the two components, the i and j components of the field, where they are zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=157.0s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	These are commonplace, and we are interested in good stuff today. And the good stuff we are interested in is limit cycles. A limit cycle is a closed trajectory with a couple of extra hypotheses. It is a closed trajectory, just like those guys, but it has something they don't have, namely, it is king of the roost.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=465.686s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And the ones that start further away will take longer to find their way to the limit cycle and they will always stay outside of the earlier guys, but they will get arbitrarily close, too. How about inside? Inside, well, it starts somewhere and does the same thing. It starts here and will try to join the limit cycle. That is what I mean by stability. Stability means that nearby guys, the guys that start somewhere else eventually approach the limit cycle, regardless of whether they start from the outside or start from the inside.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=614.569s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The positive sense means the one which keeps the region, the inside on your left, as you walk around like that the region stays on your left. That is the positive sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=1591.0s
Lec 32 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	That is the sense in which I am integrating. I am going to use Green's theorem, but the integral that I am going to calculate is not the work integral. I am going to calculate instead the flux integral, the integral that represents the flux of F across C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-meBrqcy_I#t=1602.19s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	There's a condition which guarantees their solution, which is what? What has to be true about the coefficients? These are the coefficients. What has to be true? The matrix of coefficients must be invertible. The determinant of coefficients must be nonzero. So, they are solvable if, for the c1 and c2, if this thing, I'm going to write it. Since all of these are evaluated at x0, I'm going to write it in this way. y1, the determinant, whose entries are y1, y2, y1 prime, and y2 prime, evaluated at zero, x0, that means that I evaluate each of the functions in the determinant at x0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ3-nFV6l8w#t=1435.371s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	There is another way of writing those that you should learn, and that's called finding normalized, the normalized. They are okay, but they are not normalized. For some things, the normalized solutions are the best. I'll explain to you what they are, and I'll explain to you what they're good for.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ3-nFV6l8w#t=2066.445s
Lec 11 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The initial value problem has one and only one solution. The existence is, it has a solution. The uniqueness is, it only has one solution. If you specify the initial conditions, there's only one function which satisfies them and at the same time satisfies that differential equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ3-nFV6l8w#t=2791.404s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And so far, the response, then, is the solution equals the corresponding solution, y of t, maybe with some given initial conditions to pick out a special one we call the response, the response to that particular input. And now, over the last few days, the inputs have been, however, extremely special.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWWw0jryj1A#t=120.0s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Well, I want them really on the whole real axis, not there. Define for all real numbers. Then, I say that they are orthogonal, perpendicular. But nobody says perpendicular. Orthogonal is the word, orthogonal on the interval minus pi to pi if the integral, so, two are orthogonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWWw0jryj1A#t=803.953s
Lec 15 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The answer turns out to be pi. All right, now, the ways to prove it are you can use trig identities. And, I'm asking you in one of the early problems in the problem set, identities, identities for the product of sine and cosine, expressing it in a form in which it's easy to integrate, and you can prove it that way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWWw0jryj1A#t=1163.703s
Lec 7 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, this goes to zero as t goes, and it doesn't matter what c is, as t goes to infinity. This term stays some sort of function. And so, this term is called the steady-state or long-term solution, or it's called both, a long-term solution. And this, which disappears, gets smaller and smaller as time goes on, is therefore called the transient because it disappears at the time increases to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SioXozu-Loo#t=228.397s
Lec 25 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This is a scalar. You cannot subtract the scalar from a matrix. It is not an operation. To subtract matrices they have to be the same size, the same shape. What is done is you make this a two-by-two matrix. This is a two-by-two matrix with lambdas down the main diagonal and I elsewhere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heBvViSi9xQ#t=2799.476s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, let's call it, as I called it in the notes, the exponential input theorem, which says it all. Theorem says it's important. Exponential input means it's taking f of x to be an exponential.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KbpbBMThTE#t=662.0s
Lec 13 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Okay, what's the real number? Okay, we're looking for the real part of this expression. So, just put it in and keep it mentally. So, minus one squared: that's one, plus i squared, that's minus one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KbpbBMThTE#t=1257.157s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	That's zero. So, I'm in the second case. So, i omega nought is a simple root, simple zero, of D squared plus omega nought, that polynomial squared. Therefore, the complex particular solution is now t e to the i omega nought t divided by p prime, where you plug in that root, the i omega nought.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_zrupnz0Q#t=886.36s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And, I'm going to divide it by this same guy. So, this is part of the complementary solution. That's what we call the complementary solution, the solution to the associated homogeneous equation, to the reduced equation. Call it what you like.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_zrupnz0Q#t=1311.475s
Lec 14 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And, it's only after you divided out by the m that you're allowed to call this the square of the natural frequency. So, omega naught is the natural frequency, the natural undamped frequency. If this term were not there, that omega nought would give the frequency with which the system, the little spring would like to vibrate by itself. Now, further complication is that the visual uses neither of these.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_zrupnz0Q#t=2196.623s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I will try to use all these terms now and then, probably most often I will lapse into input as the most generic term, suggesting nothing in particular, and therefore, equally acceptable or unacceptable to everybody. The response, the solution, then, the solution as you know is then called the response. The response, sometimes it's called the output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNm7XGJr4s#t=112.155s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I'll just use the word, forced system, that's where f of t is not zero, versus the passive system where there is no external applied force. The passive system, the forced system, now, you have to both, even if you wanted to solve the forced system, the way the system would behave if nothing would be done to it from the outside is nonetheless going to be an important part of the solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNm7XGJr4s#t=540.0s
Lec 12 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	In other words, when I write that, I am no longer interested in the whole equation. All I'm interested in is the reduced equation, the equation where you turn the f of t on the right-hand side into zero. So, what's the stability condition? Well, let's write it out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyNm7XGJr4s#t=2533.348s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The most closely analogous thing would be a linear equation, a real linear equation, the kind you studied in high school, which would look like this. It would have two variables, and, I guess, constant coefficients, equal c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=163.4s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	But, this is the external temperature. So, I'll indicate it with an e. Now, what is the model? Well, in other words, how do I set up a differential equation to model the situation? Well, it's based on a physical law, which I think you know, you've had simple examples like this, the so called Newton's Law of cooling, -- -- which says that the rate of change, the temperature of the heat goes from the outside to the inside by conduction only.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=745.5s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I don't think Newton got his name on this. The diffusion equation says that the rate at which the salt diffuses across the membrane, which is the same up to a constant as the rate at which the concentration inside changes, is some constant, usually called k still, okay.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=1109.5s
Lec 3 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	This, therefore, is called the steady state solution, the thing which the temperature behaves like, as T goes to infinity. This is called the transient. because it disappears as T goes to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzaX9u6YAE#t=2988.0s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Dimensionless, i.e. no units, without any units attached. It just represents the number three, not three seconds, or three grahams, or anything like that. And, the third reason is to reduce or simplify the constants: reduce the number or simplify the constants in the equation. Reduce their number is self explanatory. Simplify means make them less, either dimensionless also, or if you can't do that, at least less dependent upon the critical units than the old ones were. Let me give you a very simple example which will illustrate most of these things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBJ_iXudb-s#t=257.0s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	What is zoom? Zoom is, you increase the scale equally on both axes. So, the zoom operation is the one which sends x into a times x, and y into a times y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBJ_iXudb-s#t=1818.0s
Lec 4 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Okay, well, then I better know what y is. If I know what y is, do I know what y prime is? Oh, of course. y prime is z prime x plus z times the derivative of this factor, which is one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBJ_iXudb-s#t=2112.0s
Lec 17 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, I'll follow the book now and some of the notes and the visuals, and called the independent variable-- the dependent variable I'm going to call x now. And, the independent variable is, as usual, time. So, this is going to be, in general, f of t, and I'm going to use it by calculating example, this is the actual f of t I'm going to be using. But, the general problem for a general f of t is to solve this, or at least to find a particular solution. That's what most of the work is, because we already know how from that to get the general solution by adding the solution to the reduced equation, the associated homogeneous equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0_EQLxHcw#t=886.759s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Today, once again, a day of solving no differential equations whatsoever. The topic is a special kind of differential equation, which occurs a lot. It's one in which the right-hand side doesn't have any independent variable in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=0.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Maybe we can make one line out of a proof. To say that it's a solution, what does it mean to say that it's a solution? It means to say that when you plug it in, plug in this constant function, y0, the dy0 dt is equal to f of y0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=504.076s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Let's assume it's a continuous interest rate. All banks nowadays pay interest continuously, the continuous interest rate. So, if that's all there is, and money is growing, you know the differential equation says that the rate at which it grows is equal to r, the interest rate times a principle, the amount that's in the bank at that time. So, that's the differential equation that governs that. Now, that's, of course, the solution is simply an exponential curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=842.28s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Logistic growth says that calling k a constant is unrealistic because the Earth is not filled entirely with people. What stops it from having unlimited growth? Well, the fact that the resources, the food, the organism has to live on gets depleted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=1453.0s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, these guys don't mean anything physically, but mathematically they exist. Their solutions, they're going down like that. Now, you notice from this picture that there are, even though both of these are constant solutions, they have dramatically different behavior. This one, this solution, is the one that all other solutions try to approach as time goes to infinity. This one, the solution zero, is repulsive, as it were.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=1935.402s
Lec 5 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	I wonder how long it to do think that one up, semi-stable critical point: stable on one side, unstable on the other depending on whether you start below it. And, of course, it could be reversed if I had drawn the picture the other way. I could have approached it from the top, and left it from below. You get the idea of the behavior. Okay, let's now take, I'm going to soup up this logistic equation just a little bit more. So, let's talk about the logistic equation. But, I'm going to add to it harvesting, with harvesting. So, this is a very late 20th century concept. So, we imagine, for example, a bunch of formerly free range Atlantic salmon penned in one of these huge factory farms off the coast of Maine or someplace. They've made salmon much cheaper than it used to be, but at a certain cost to the salmon, and possibly to our environment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te6Mplq3DCU#t=2140.55s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, this is the initial condition, and this is the first order differential equation. And, as you know, the two of them together are called an IVP, an initial value problem, which means two things, the differential equation and the initial value that you want to start the solution at.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKKzMag5Rc#t=95.0s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Okay, now, the method we are going to talk about, the basic method of which many others are merely refinements in one way or another, is called Euler's method. Euler, who did, of course, everything in analysis, as far as I know, didn't actually use it to compute solutions of differential equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKKzMag5Rc#t=119.18s
Lec 2 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	The whole difficulty is, this is called a singular point. The solution has a singularity, in other words, a single place where it goes to infinity or becomes discontinuous, maybe as a jump discontinuity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKKzMag5Rc#t=2980.0s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	You would never see something like that but it is okay. What else do you need to know? Well, what would a homogenous system be? A homogenous system is one without these extra guys. That doesn't mean there is no t in it. There could be t in the a, b, c and d, but these terms with no x and y in them must not occur. So, a linear homogenous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=255.039s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	And that is the kind we are going to start studying first in the same way when we studied higher order equations. We studied first homogenous. You had to know how to solve those first, and then you could learn how to solve the more general kind. So linear homogenous means that r1 is zero and r2 is zero for all time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=287.0s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Remember what the first order word was? A first order equation where there was no t explicitly on the right-hand side, we called it, anybody remember? Just curious. Autonomous, right. This is an autonomous system. It is not a linear system because these are messy functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=2385.747s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	It is the velocity of the solution at time t. If I think of the solution as being a parameterized motion. All I have drawn here is the trace, the path of the motion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=2633.887s
Lec 24 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Stop me. Not enough here. So on and so on. We can say a system of first order equations, ODEs of first order equations, autonomous because there must be no t on the right-hand side, is equal to a velocity field. A field of velocity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrDzhpu3-s#t=2733.0s
Lec 6 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	In my analysis class, these are some math majors, or graduate engineers in various subjects, and if I say prove such and such using the exponential law, I'm sure to get at least half a dozen e-mails asking me, what's the exponential law? Okay, the exponential law is a to the x times a to the y equals a to the x plus y: the law of exponents.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQJBp6Ym-6A#t=444.563s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	So, we are talking about first order ODEs. ODE: I'll only use two acronyms. ODE is ordinary differential equations. I think all of MIT knows that, whether they've been taking the course or not. So, we are talking about first-order ODEs, which in standard form, are written, you isolate the derivative of y with respect to, x, let's say, on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side you write everything else. You can't always do this very well, but for today, I'm going to assume that it has been done and it's doable. So, for example, some of the ones that will be considered either today or in the problem set are things like y prime equals x over y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=60.55s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Of course, the differential equation has many solutions containing an arbitrary constant. So, we'll call this the solution. Now, the geometric view, the geometric guy that corresponds to this version of writing the equation, is something called a direction field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=337.243s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Now, the integral curve, so those are the line elements. The integral curve is a curve, which goes through the plane, and at every point is tangent to the line element there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=470.846s
Lec 1 | MIT 18.03 Differential Equations, Spring 2006	Now, why can't you to have this? That's much more sophisticated than this, and the reason is because of something called the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem, which says that there is through a point, x zero y zero, that y prime equals f of (x, y) has only one, and only one solution. One has one solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhJ8lVGbl8#t=2465.0s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	But, yeah, this is the definition of Lipschitz, or K-Lipschitz, which is that there exists a K such that the distance between the image points is less than or equal to K times the distance of the original points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=182.712s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	I'm going to redefine what uniform continuity means for metric spaces. But most of the theory will still hold up. So definition, uniform continuity-- a function f from metric space x to metric space y is uniformly continuous if, for all epsilon bigger than 0, there exists a delta bigger than 0 such that if the distance between two points x and y in x is less than delta, then the distance between the image points in y, f of x, f of y, is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=305.39s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	I want to reiterate this point. Metric spaces give us the ability to view functions as single points. There are things that we can manipulate and plug in and figure out the distances between.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=1878.25s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	For this method, what we do is we define the real numbers as the smallest set that contains the rational numbers such that every bounded set, its upper bound is in the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=2471.81s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	I won't go through the proof, because it's very similar to what's on your homework, but I'll definitely talk through it, which is the set C at lower infinity of M, which is the set of functions f, which are continuous, with the supremum of m and M of f of m bounded-- so this is less than infinity-- as a metric space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=3060.9s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	But there's quite a few more examples that we can consider. These examples show up, for instance, in 18.102, in very, very important ways. So example-- consider normed spaces. These are vector spaces with a norm put on them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=3741.16s
Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces	So, specifically, consider C C0 functions on, let's say, a metric space-- what do I want to say? I'll say the metric space x. No, I'll just say on R. So this is a set of compactly supported functions on the real numbers that are continuous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bPEZYhh1P4#t=3908.12s
Lecture 2: General Theory	Cauchy sequences-- ope, sorry. Convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences. Suppose xn is the convergent sequence we're considering, and that xn converges to x. Then we know that-- and I'm going to say this over and over again, just like we do in real analysis, but at a certain point, it just becomes second-hand nature-- so therefore, for all epsilon bigger than 0, there exists n in the natural numbers such that for all n bigger than or equal to n, the distance from xn to x is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS-w4yl35vc#t=775.85s
Lecture 2: General Theory	These are known as De Morgan's laws. I'm going to switch which chalk I'm using. This states that the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements-- so i am A. And similarly, the complement of an intersection-- Ui complement i and A-- is equal to the union of the complements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS-w4yl35vc#t=2641.27s
Lecture 2: General Theory	OK. So just a small note. Any open set U contained in your metric space can be written as a union, a potentially infinite union, of open balls. I'll outline briefly how to do this right now.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS-w4yl35vc#t=3018.24s
Lecture 2: General Theory	Definition-- a neighborhood of a point y is simply an open set that contains y-- containing y. For our purposes, though, you can just think of this open neighborhood as a ball, right? Because I've stated that every open set can be written as a union of infinitely many balls.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS-w4yl35vc#t=4252.03s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	And if any of the notation I use doesn't make sense, I'm happy to elaborate. But this is the notation for if and only if. And then finally, the most important one, arguably, though the hardest one to show most of the time, is the triangle inequality, that the distance between x and z is less than or equal to the distance from x to y plus the distance from y to z.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=285.063s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	So let me go ahead and write that down. A metric space is a set x with a function d, which will be called our metric, which takes in two points in x and spits out a real number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=337.525s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	And I can do this for every single point in the interval 0 to 1. This is what makes it an open interval. And the definition of an open set is going to be essentially the same, where instead, the definition of the ball of radius epsilon, this is defined as the set of points in your metric space such that the distance from x to y is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=1128.19s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	Then I say that f is continuous, continuous, if for all epsilon bigger than 0 there exists a delta bigger than 0, such that if the distance between two points x and y is less than delta-- or, sorry, dx-- then the distances in the space y of f of x and f of y is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=1289.22s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	So, definition-- actually, I'll just define it for ck. This is the set of continuous functions on ab such that the first k derivatives of f1 exist, and two are continuous. This is the set of what are known as continuously differentiable functions, so ones in which when I take the derivative, this-- the derivative is going to be continuous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=2149.98s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	You instead sum over the 0th derivative, the first derivative, so on and so forth, up until the kth derivative. And that's fine. What if I want to study it on smooth functions, which I'll define right now? We define c infinity ab to be the set of smooth functions, i.e., infinitely differentiable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=2394.81s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	A vector space is simply a space in which you can add two terms together, and it'll stay in the same space. This isn't a class on linear algebra, so there's not going to be too many times when the definition of a vector space comes up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=3299.0s
Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples	Example-- consider the sphere S1 to be the set of x in, let's say, R3 such that-- actually, you know what? I'll just do a circle, the circle of radius 1 in R2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQOfK3ZLRU#t=3406.05s
Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces	Bolzano-Weierstrass. And to use closed and bounded, to show topologically compact, we had to use the Heine-Borel theorem, where we trapped our compact set inside of a closed cube. And we know that that closed cube is going to be compact, but we don't always have these closed cubes on metric spaces, right? What does it mean for there to be a cube of functions? And in fact, in general, these implications are not going to be precisely true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv3xYk85Lq0#t=43.16s
Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces	And as such, we're going to define a new term. So definition-- the term is known as totally bounded. A-- or I should say metric space-- let's call it x-- is totally bounded if, for all epsilon bigger than 0, there exists y1 through yk such that the union of balls of radius epsilon around the finitely many yi's contains x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv3xYk85Lq0#t=623.59s
Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces	These are the inverse images of open sets. And so what we know is that we can reach a finite subcover-- a finite subcover given by f inverse Ui from, let's say, i equals 1 to k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv3xYk85Lq0#t=1680.3s
Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces	But it's much more general than the extreme value theorem. Before, the extreme value theorem was a map from the real numbers, or at least a compact subset, like a to b, to the real numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv3xYk85Lq0#t=1856.02s
Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces	Therefore, there exists a finite subcover given by, let's say, the union from i equals 1 to k of ci complement. And what we're going to show is then that it fails to have the finite intersection property.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv3xYk85Lq0#t=2671.04s
Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ	And so let's define what that is now. A vector space is a set V with addition which takes in 2 vectors-- so V cross V-- and maps it to another vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdrCzc3DxLg#t=108.838s
Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ	"""-tative."" Two, associative, meaning that A plus B plus C is A plus B plus C. We want there to be a distributive law. ""-butative."" And I'll just state one more. We have the identity, by which I mean 0 and 1-- or sorry."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdrCzc3DxLg#t=182.45s
Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ	But what about when we're looking at functions on R? Well, here we can similarly define L1 functions on R to be the set of functions-- this is loosely-- functions f such that the integral from minus infinity to infinity of f of x dx is less than infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdrCzc3DxLg#t=902.42s
Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ	And we know that a union of closed sets, a finite union of closed sets, is closed. So we know that it's closed. The fact that it's bounded comes from the fact that there's only finitely many points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdrCzc3DxLg#t=1491.05s
Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ	And the finite subcover will look like this. A is the subset of the union from i equal 1 to, let's say, m of balls of radius i around p. But each of these balls are contained in one another, right? As I make the radius larger, it's going to be contained to the next one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdrCzc3DxLg#t=3231.97s
Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here	A topology T on a set x is a collection of subsets of x such that, one, the empty set and the entire met-- or not metric space-- the entire set is in your topology.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re2cL2GfUfM#t=301.7s
Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here	So again, just to reiterate, a topology is just a collection of subsets of the metric space X-- or not metric space-- the set X such that the empty set and the entirety of the set is in the topology.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re2cL2GfUfM#t=365.54s
Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here	A Banach space is a normed space that's Cauchy complete, essentially. The only difference is that it's complete with respect to the metric because, again, we have a notion of Cauchy completeness in terms of metric spaces, so we want it to be compatible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re2cL2GfUfM#t=1300.64s
Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here	In order to even have the possibility of defining or showing that a space is a Banach space, you need to have a notion of a norm. So the norm on it-- the norm on T, known as the operator norm, is simply the supremum over x in-- x and capital X with the norm of x equal to 1 of T of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re2cL2GfUfM#t=1512.38s
Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here	So an inner product space is a set or a vector space, X, with an inner product defined on it. And specifically, we want this inner product, as usual, to have three main properties.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re2cL2GfUfM#t=1692.02s
Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here	So specifically, you can have something like this. Inner product spaces are a subset of norm spaces. And Hilbert spaces are inner product spaces that are Cauchy complete-- so therefore are Banach spaces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re2cL2GfUfM#t=1952.05s
L10.2 Conditional PDFs	By now, we have introduced all sorts of PMFs for the discrete case. The joint PMF, the conditional PMF-- given an event-- and the conditional PMF of one random variable given another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj6iEzXsFkI#t=1.26s
L10.2 Conditional PDFs	We would like to do something similar for the conditional PDF, where we would like to take the event A to be something like the event that Y is equal to some particular value-- little y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj6iEzXsFkI#t=120.88s
L10.2 Conditional PDFs	But as we said, this is problematic, because this event does not have positive probability. So instead, we can take A to be the event that Y is approximately equal to a certain value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj6iEzXsFkI#t=133.45s
L07.4 Independence of Random Variables	Namely, the joint PMF of all the random variables can be expressed as the product of the corresponding marginal PMFs. What is the intuitive interpretation of independence here? It means that information about some of the random variables will not change your beliefs, the probabilities, about the remaining random variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6H50Hbulbk#t=254.15s
L07.4 Independence of Random Variables	Any conditional probabilities and any conditional PMFs will be the same as the unconditional ones. In the real world, independence models situations where each of the random variables is generated in a decoupled manner, in a separate probabilistic experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6H50Hbulbk#t=278.98s
L07.2 Conditional PMFs	And this leads us to this definition of conditional PMFs. The conditional PMF is defined to be the ratio of the joint PMF-- this is the probability that we have here-- by the corresponding marginal PMF.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Q3M_HV94w#t=85.49s
L07.2 Conditional PMFs	Using the definition of conditional probabilities, this is the probability that all events happen divided by the probability of the conditioning event, which, in our case, is the event that Y takes on a specific value and simultaneously, Z takes another specific value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Q3M_HV94w#t=518.52s
L07.2 Conditional PMFs	In PMF notation, this is the ratio of the joint PMF of the three random variables together, divided by the joint PMF of the two random variables Y and Z. As another example, we could have an expression like this, which, again, stands for the probability that these two random variables take on specific values, conditional on this random variable taking on another value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Q3M_HV94w#t=541.28s
L19.6 Normal Approximation to the Binomial	And this is 1.33. Now, at this point, we pretend that Zn is a standard normal random variable-- the probability that the standard normal is less than a certain number. This is the standard normal CDF evaluated at that number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBfMIVXc_OM#t=261.12s
L22.8 The Fresh Start Property and Its Implications	The Poisson process starts fresh at time t. We have the fresh start property. And similar to the language we use for the Bernoulli process, the fresh start property means that you see a process that's independent of the past and which has the same statistical properties as if this was time 0, as if the process was just starting right now.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_rzDNLODQw#t=162.52s
L26.6 Absorption Probabilities	As indicated in this definition, an absorbing state is a recurrent state from which you cannot escape once you get to it. The transition probabilities from k to k is 1. So in some sense, you get absorbed by the state.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEsUsaK1HBk#t=16.69s
S07.3 Independence of Random Variables Versus Independence of Events	So let us suppose that random variables X and Y are independent. What does that mean? Independence means that the joint PMF of the two random variables, X and Y, factors as a product of the corresponding marginal PMFs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOmLwHaa8Ik#t=145.44s
L03.8 Independence Versus Pairwise Independence	How are we to understand this intuitively? If I tell you that event H1 occurred and I ask you for the conditional probability of C given that H1 [occurred], what is this? This is the probability that we obtain, given that the first event is heads, the first result is heads, the only way that you can have the two tosses having the same result is going to be in the second toss also resulting in heads.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJXfyfQs2Mc#t=332.33s
L02.2 Conditional Probabilities	Conditional probabilities are probabilities associated with a revised model that takes into account some additional information about the outcome of a probabilistic experiment. The question is how to carry out this revision of our model.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPRKc4UPoJk#t=2.33s
L14.10 Summary	We have seen two particular ways of constructing estimates or estimators. One of them is the maximum a posteriori probability rule in which we choose an estimate that maximizes the posterior distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hDfZF64wic#t=120.94s
L14.10 Summary	Another estimator is the one that we call the LMS or least mean squares estimator, which calculates the conditional expectation of the unknown parameter, given the observations that we have obtained. Finally, we may be interested in evaluating the performance of a given estimator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hDfZF64wic#t=156.46s
L13.2 Conditional Expectation as a Random Variable	Which random variable? It is the random variable that takes the value little x squared whenever capital X, the random variable, happens to take the value little x. And this is the random variable that we usually denote as the random variable X squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=strrrdJivco#t=44.77s
L11.8 A Nonmonotonic Example	Now, we want to express this probability in terms of the CDF of X. The probability that we're looking at, the probability of this interval, is equal to the probability that x is less than or equal to the square root of y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFx7fWujWsU#t=273.58s
L14.9 Inferring the Unknown Bias of a Coin - Point Estimates	That is, instead of just providing the posterior, we would like to select a specific estimate for the unknown bias. Let us look at the maximum a posteriori probability estimate. How can we find it? By definition, the MAP estimate is that value of theta that maximizes the posterior, the value of theta at which the posterior is largest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJSPef9zC0c#t=29.83s
L21.5 The Fresh Start Property	In a Bernoulli process, each trial has a probability of being 1 and the probability of being 0. But since, in your case, you're certain to watch 1's in the beginning, this means that the random variables that you see do not conform to the description of a Bernoulli process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi_iT9Rh434#t=601.51s
L13.9 Section Means and Variances	The conditional expectation is a random variable that takes these two values with certain probabilities. And the mean of this random variable is equal to 70. Let us now calculate the variance of this random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjjkSM1Dasg#t=258.85s
L13.9 Section Means and Variances	We're given this information, and this tells us the variance of the student scores within the second section. So now we can describe the abstract conditional variance. It is a random variable that takes this value with probability equal to the probability of selecting someone from this section, which is 1/3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjjkSM1Dasg#t=372.05s
L13.9 Section Means and Variances	The other term looks at the means in the different sections, and figures out how different are these means. How much do they vary from the overall class average? It measures the variability between different sections.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjjkSM1Dasg#t=490.03s
L20.4 On the Mean Squared Error of an Estimator	Let us see what they are in a concrete setting. Suppose that we're estimating the unknown mean of some distribution, and that our estimator is the sample mean. In this case, the mean squared error is the variance, which we know to be sigma squared over n, plus the bias term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lET4uQLpmM0#t=89.039s
L12.5 Covariance	So the random variables X and Y typically have opposite signs, and on the average, the expected value of X times Y is going to be negative. So here we have a positive expectation, here we have a negative expectation of X times Y. This quantity, the expected value of X times Y, tells us whether X and Y tend to move in the same or in opposite directions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Tlj27nkjs#t=114.28s
S23.2 Poisson Arrivals During an Exponential Interval	Let's see what it would take if we wanted to solve the problem using formulas. So let's call N-T, with capital T, the number of arrivals until time T in our Poisson process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMZtGUdTVw#t=47.19s
S23.2 Poisson Arrivals During an Exponential Interval	And this is arrival number K. So K is a random variable, and we want to find what it is. So what are we asking? What is K? K is the number of arrivals in the merged process until you get an arrival in the merged process which is coming from the blue process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMZtGUdTVw#t=326.29s
S23.2 Poisson Arrivals During an Exponential Interval	So what do we know about those trials? What are their statistical properties? First, what is the probability of success? The probability of success is the probability that when you get an arrival in the merged process, it is coming from the blue process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMZtGUdTVw#t=444.29s
S23.2 Poisson Arrivals During an Exponential Interval	In other words, the origin of this arrival is statistically independent from the origin of that arrival. So this means that these trials are independent. So what we're looking at is a random variable, which is the number of trials until the first success, in a sequence of independent trials, where each trial has a success probability equal to that value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMZtGUdTVw#t=504.36s
L03.7 Independence of a Collection of Events	What is the right definition? Let us start with intuition. We will say that a family of events are independent if knowledge about some of the events doesn't change my beliefs, my probability model, for the remaining events.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbQcqFH33G0#t=49.72s
L25.5 Recurrent and Transient States: Review	So both of these are recurrent as well. So in a case the state is not recurrent, we will call it transient. So let's look at for example state one. From state one, if you go from one to two and then go to six, there is no way to come back to one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKhhEc_LyQ#t=63.54s
L25.5 Recurrent and Transient States: Review	So what we have seen also is the notion of a recurrent class. A recurrent class is, again, a collection of recurrent states that can communicate between each other. So here, for this specific example, we have two classes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKhhEc_LyQ#t=92.9s
L22.10 An Example	And this is why we can multiply their probabilities. Now, let us think of the alternative approach, a different way of describing this event using arrival and inter-arrival times. What is this event? This is the event that no arrival happened until this time, but an arrival happened before time 5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvGuBQZZuLM#t=347.02s
L22.10 An Example	The next question is, what is the probability that we catch at least two fish? Under this scenario, we catch one fish and we stop. Therefore, this scenario must have materialized. The event of catching at least two fish is the scenario that from time from 0 until 2, we caught at least two fish.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvGuBQZZuLM#t=389.91s
L22.10 An Example	So we're talking about the probability of catching at least two fish, which is the probability of catching k fish during a time interval of length 2, where k can be anything from 2 to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvGuBQZZuLM#t=414.17s
L22.10 An Example	And then we multiply this term with the conditional expectation of the remaining fishing time, given that you got to fish for more than 2 times units. So what is this term? The probability that you get to fish for more than 2 time units, this is the probability that no fish were caught during the first time units.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvGuBQZZuLM#t=666.87s
L03.3 Independence of Two Events	So we see that being independent is something completely different from being disjoint. Independence is a relation about information. It is important to always keep in mind the intuitive meaning of independence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w423ypsUHf0#t=297.7s
L03.3 Independence of Two Events	Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not change our beliefs about the other. It does not affect the probability that the other event also occurs. When do we have independence in the real world? The typical case is when the occurrence or non-occurrence of each of the two events A and B is determined by two physically distinct and non-interacting processes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w423ypsUHf0#t=312.45s
L01.1 Lecture Overview	In fact, today we will accomplish a lot. By the end of this lecture, you will know about all of the elements of a probabilistic model. A probabilistic model is a quantitative description of a situation, a phenomenon, or an experiment whose outcome is uncertain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uW3qMFA9Ho#t=14.5s
L09.4 Memorylessness of the Exponential PDF	We are interested in how much longer the light bulb will be operating, and so we look at capital X, which is the remaining lifetime from the current time until the light bulb burns out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxnPEDecIA#t=94.77s
L02.4 Conditional Probabilities Obey the Same Axioms	How about another axiom? What is the probability of the entire sample space, given the event B? Let's check it out. By definition, the conditional probability is the probability of the intersection of the two events involved divided by the probability of the conditioning event.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_pEeYLGaP0#t=56.59s
L09.5 Total Probability & Expectation Theorems	Let X be a continuous random variable and let us take B to be the event that the random variable takes a value less than or equal to some little x. By the total probability theorem, this is the probability of the first scenario times the conditional probability of this event given that the first scenario has materialized, and then we have similar terms for the other scenarios.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv8tuMBQk-g#t=29.18s
L09.5 Total Probability & Expectation Theorems	And so we use this notation to denote the conditional CDF, the CDF that applies to the conditional universe. And then we have similar terms for the other scenarios. Now, we know that the derivative of a CDF is a PDF.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv8tuMBQk-g#t=89.0s
L17.6 LLMS for Inferring the Parameter of a Coin	Let's start with the expected value of X. Since we know the conditional expectation of X, we can use the law of iterated expectations. The unconditional expectation is the expected value of the conditional expectation, which is n times Theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CkWjk40TBY#t=186.06s
L25.10 Birth-Death Processes - Part I	If lots of people already have the flu, the probability that another person catches it would be pretty high. But if no one has the flu, then the probability that one gets a transition-- where someone catches the flu-- would be pretty small.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKYpKYspe1w#t=154.21s
L01.2 Sample Space	Namely, the elements should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. What does that mean? Mutually exclusive means that, if at the end of the experiment, I tell you that this outcome happened, then it should not be possible that this outcome also happened.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ2edOqEQAs#t=85.98s
L14.1 Lecture Overview	Given any particular method for coming up with a point estimate, there are certain performance metrics that tell us how good the estimate is. For hypothesis testing problems, the appropriate metric is the probability of error, the probability of making a mistake.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNLEnFtWwhg#t=82.7s
L21.7 The Time of the K-th Arrival	So think of k as being fixed and t as a parameter that varies, and we want to carry out this calculation for all possible choices of t. Now, what is this event here? This is the event that the kth arrival occurs at time t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-enGdJ-j8s#t=250.4s
L01.7 A Discrete Example	So we could have both equal to 2. We could have X equal to 2, but Y larger. Or we could have Y equal to 2 and X something larger. This green event, this green set, is the set of all outcomes for which the minimum of the two rolls is equal to 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsSQdpZdP8U#t=166.1s
S01.1 Sets	Everything outside the set S, we denote it this way, and we call it the complement of the set S. And it is defined formally as follows-- an element belongs to the complement of S if x is an element of our universal set, and also x does not belong to S. Notice that if we take the complement of the complement-- that is, anything that does not belong to the green set-- we get back the red set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47W1ApSRUqs#t=179.17s
S01.1 Sets	So what this is saying is that the complement of the complement of a set is the set itself. Another set of particular interest is the so-called empty set. The empty set is a set that contains no elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47W1ApSRUqs#t=215.0s
S01.1 Sets	We can also form the intersection of two sets, which we denote this way, and which stands for the collection of elements that belong to both of the sets. So formally, an element belongs to the intersection of two sets if and only if that element belongs to both of them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47W1ApSRUqs#t=364.27s
S01.1 Sets	Given this infinite collection, we can still define their union to be the set of all elements that belong to one of those sets Sn that we started with. That is, an element is going to belong to that union if and only if this element belongs to some of the sets that we started with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47W1ApSRUqs#t=425.97s
L04.7 Partitions	We want to count to the number of ways that this can be done. This is the number of ways that we can partition a given set into subsets of prescribed sizes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJjiCrdsNV8#t=59.38s
L14.7 Continuous Parameter, Continuous Observation	And then the alternative one is the least mean squares estimator, which just computes the expected value of Theta given X. For any given estimator, we then want to characterize its performance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN_TJBPv2Qs#t=150.2s
L07.5 Example	So suppose, for example, that someone tells us that the outcome of the experiment was such that it belongs to this blue set. This is the set where X is less than or equal to 2, and Y is larger than or equal to three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsEvwRGa1JA#t=142.96s
L19.7 Polling Revisited	Let us remind ourselves of the setting. We want to estimate a certain number, p, which is the fraction of the population that will vote yes in a certain referendum. And we estimate p by picking a sample out of the population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxpC3MEiATQ#t=24.92s
L21.8 Merging of Bernoulli Processes	So we're trying to calculate the conditional probability of the blue event given that the green event has occurred. We use the definition of conditional probabilities. A conditional probability is equal to the probability that both events happen, which in this case is the intersection of the blue and the green event, which coincides with the blue event.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyCLokHV774#t=387.7s
S01.3 Sequences and their Limits	And what we mean by this is that we have i, an index that runs over the natural numbers, which is the set of positive integers, and each ai is an element of some set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuhlfBPQPq0#t=37.78s
L05.1 Lecture Overview	In this lecture, we introduce the notion of a random variable. A random variable is, loosely speaking, a numerical quantity whose value is determined by the outcome of a probabilistic experiment. The weight of a randomly selected student is one example.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArfHGPHL8kU#t=0.2s
L05.1 Lecture Overview	After giving a general definition, we will focus exclusively on discrete random variables. These are random variables that take values in finite or countably infinite sets. For example, random variables that take integer values are discrete.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArfHGPHL8kU#t=18.52s
L05.1 Lecture Overview	And finally we will introduce a new concept- the expected value of the random variable, also called the expectation or mean. It is a weighted average of the values of the random variable, weighted according to their respective probabilities, and has an intuitive interpretation as the average value we expect to see if we repeat the same probabilistic experiment independently a large number of times.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArfHGPHL8kU#t=55.2s
L24.5 N-Step Transition Probabilities	But you may be able to give probabilistic prediction. That is, to give the probability for the system to be in a given state 900 time steps later. Our main purpose will be to calculate such probabilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwwqPwp16_0#t=50.19s
L06.5 Total Expectation Theorem	So what we have established is this particular formula, which is called the Total Expectation Theorem. It tells us that the expected value of a random variable can be calculated by considering different scenarios.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnEyIawrWBg#t=194.82s
L06.5 Total Expectation Theorem	One way to divide and conquer is to define an event, A1, which is that our random variable takes values in this set, and another event, A2, which is that the random variable takes values in that set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnEyIawrWBg#t=265.32s
L25.7 Steady-State Probabilities and Convergence	The rij's do converge to a steady-state limit, which we call a steady-state probability as long as these two conditions are satisfied. So in summary, not only these two conditions are necessary, like we had seen with our counter example, but they are sufficient.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99yuPxvdfP8#t=157.32s
L25.7 Steady-State Probabilities and Convergence	So at time 4, both of them are here. Now, think a little bit about the future evolution of these two independent copies, given that they are in state 4 now. And here we are using the Markov property to say that the future evolution of the blue copy is independent of the previous path.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99yuPxvdfP8#t=278.49s
L11.9 The PDF of a Function of Multiple Random Variables	So now let us write an expression for the CDF of Z, which, by definition, is the probability that the random variable Z, which in our case is Y divided by X, is less than or equal than a certain number, little z.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-krLprDrOI#t=87.58s
L11.1 Lecture Overview	In this lecture, we will deal with a single topic. How to find the distribution, that is, the PMF or PDF of a random variable that is defined as a function of one or more other random variables with known distributions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5mV88S2fNY#t=0.26s
L23.4 Where is an Arrival of the Merged Process Coming From?	We are told that there was an arrival at time t or an arrival during an interval, a small interval around time t. This means that we're told that this event here has happened.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgAhDIdbUK8#t=42.64s
L23.4 Where is an Arrival of the Merged Process Coming From?	So essentially, we're dealing with 10 Bernoulli trials, each of which has two possible outcomes, red or green, and is red with this particular probability. Therefore, the answer is going to be given by the binomial probabilities, which is the probability of having four successes in 10 trials.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgAhDIdbUK8#t=223.13s
L15.4 The Case of Multiple Observations	We are now ready to move on to a model which is quite interesting and quite realistic. This is a model in which we have an unknown parameter modeled as a random variable that we try to estimate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT0ptFu6dVA#t=0.7s
L15.4 The Case of Multiple Observations	What is the mean of this normal distribution? The mean is same as the peak. And to find the peak, the location at which this PDF is largest, what we do is we try to find the place at which this quadratic function is smallest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT0ptFu6dVA#t=495.37s
L03.1 Lecture Overview	We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. If, for any two of the events in the collection we have independence between them, we will say that we have pairwise independence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXKgTPR_8wk#t=50.89s
L18.4 The Weak Law of Large Numbers	So the theoretical average, the expected value of the sample mean, is equal to the true mean. Let us now calculate the variance of the sample mean. The variance of a random variable divided by a number is the variance of that random variable divided by the square of that number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh5bR7X3ch8#t=162.47s
L18.4 The Weak Law of Large Numbers	We're now in a position to apply the Chebyshev inequality. The Chebyshev inequality tells us that the distance of a random variable from its mean, being larger than a certain number, has a probability that's bounded above by the variance of the random variable of interest divided by the square of the number that we have here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh5bR7X3ch8#t=209.34s
L14.3 Types of Inference Problems	On the other hand, there may be variables that are unknown, that are unobserved-- variables that are part of the model, but whose values are not known. In such cases, we still want to use data to make some predictions or decisions about those unobserved variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5fOm80VAnc#t=30.37s
L14.3 Types of Inference Problems	There are problems that we call hypothesis testing problems. In those problems the unknown takes one out of a few possible values. That is, we may have a few different alternative models of the world.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5fOm80VAnc#t=210.1s
L14.3 Types of Inference Problems	We were getting a radar reading. And the question was to make an inference whether the radar is seeing an airplane or whether an airplane is not present. So in hypothesis testing problems, we're essentially making a choice out of a small number of discrete possible choices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5fOm80VAnc#t=251.62s
L05.3 Probability Mass Functions	This is just a piece of notation, not a new concept. We're dealing with a probability, and we indicate it using this particular notation. More formally, the probability that we're dealing with is the probability, the total probability, of all outcomes for which the numerical value of our random variable is this particular number, x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW1_iugJvF0#t=173.9s
L05.3 Probability Mass Functions	The way we're going to do it is to consider each possible value of z, one at a time, and for any particular value find out what are the outcomes-- the elements of the sample space-- for which our random variable takes on the specific value, and add the probabilities of those outcomes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW1_iugJvF0#t=491.53s
L03.9 Reliability	"Consider a particular system that consists of three components. And we will say that the system is ""up"", if there exists a path from the left to the right that consists of units that are ""up""."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDkq_cLVSmc#t=215.29s
L03.9 Reliability	"And the same for the third unit. So we have derived a formula that tells us the reliability, the probability that a system of this kind is ""up"" in terms of the probabilities of its individual components."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDkq_cLVSmc#t=411.27s
L18.6 Convergence in Probability	We will now take a step towards abstraction, and discuss the issue of convergence of random variables. Let us look at the weak law of large numbers. It tells us that with high probability, the sample mean falls close to the true mean as n goes to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajar_6MAOLw#t=0.69s
L18.6 Convergence in Probability	When we're dealing with convergence of numbers, we start with a sequence of numbers, and we are interested in the statement that this sequence converges to a certain limit. What does that mean? What we mean is that the elements of the sequence eventually-- that is, when n is large enough-- will get and stay arbitrarily close to this particular number a, which is the limit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajar_6MAOLw#t=133.9s
L16.5 Example: The LMS Estimate	If I tell you that X takes on this specific value, this means that we now live in this universe. And it means that all of those thetas are possible. The posterior distribution is going to be a distribution that tells us the probabilities of these different thetas.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-dyKz5dpeY#t=230.44s
L10.9 Mixed Bayes Rule	But it is a conditional PMF. It describes to us the probability distribution of the discrete random variable K when the random variable Y, which happens to be a continuous one, takes on a specific value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=363JQxFwLXg#t=275.2s
L10.9 Mixed Bayes Rule	And we obtain this version of the Bayes rule. It gives us the conditional probability of a random variable K given that a certain continuous random variable Y has taken on a specific value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=363JQxFwLXg#t=320.78s
L05.11 Linearity of Expectations	And generously, the new salary is twice the old salary plus a bonus of $100. What happens to the expected value of the salary, or the average salary? Well the new average salary, which is the expected value of 2X plus 100, is twice the old average plus 100.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IJFBMIU6x4#t=34.53s
L01.3 Sample Space Examples	Let us now look at some examples of sample spaces. Sample spaces are sets. And a set can be discrete, finite, infinite, continuous, and so on. Let us start with a simpler case in which we have a sample space that is discrete and finite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__T3eJtjoic#t=2.66s
L09.2 Conditioning A Continuous Random Variable on an Event	We can take this relation here to be the definition of a conditional PDF. So a conditional PDF is a function that allows us to calculate probabilities by integrating this function over the event or set of interest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHj4A1gh_ws#t=110.509s
S01.6 The Geometric Series	One particular series that shows up in many applications, examples, or problems is the geometric series. [In] the geometric series, we are given a certain number, alpha, and we want to sum all the powers of alpha, starting from the 0th power, which is equal to 1, the first power, and so on, and this gives us an infinite series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmWW7Hu43A#t=1.46s
L12.2 The Sum of Independent Discrete Random Variables	This formula is called the convolution formula. It is the convolution of two PMFs. What convolution means is that somebody gives us the PMF of one random variable, gives us also the PMF of another random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbu8KQx9bqM#t=213.01s
L12.2 The Sum of Independent Discrete Random Variables	So when the diagrams are arranged this way, then we have a simpler job to do. We look at corresponding terms, those that sit on top of each other, multiply them, do that for all the possible choices, and then add those products together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbu8KQx9bqM#t=403.11s
L11.6 The Monotonic Case	When does this happen? When the value of g of x is less than y. And that happens for x's in this range. So, this is the set of x's for which is the value of g of x is less than or equal to this particular number y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaI-oaOBHKU#t=315.31s
L03.5 Conditional Independence	Conditional probabilities are like ordinary probabilities, except that they apply to a new situation where some additional information is available. For this reason, any concept relevant to probability models has a counterpart that applies to conditional probability models.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B3cDe39lwY#t=1.94s
L03.5 Conditional Independence	Conditional independence is defined as ordinary independence but with respect to the conditional probabilities. To be more precise, remember that independence is defined in terms of this relation, that the probability of two events happening is the product of the probabilities that one of them is happening times the probability that the other one is happening.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B3cDe39lwY#t=44.69s
L20.2 Overview of the Classical Statistical Framework	And let me close with some comments on the different types of problems that we may encounter in classical statistics. One class of problems are so-called hypothesis testing problems in which we're asked to choose between two candidate models.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMHJPEcoC08#t=467.39s
L20.2 Overview of the Classical Statistical Framework	What we want to do is to design an estimator-- a way of processing the data-- that comes up with estimates that are good. What does it mean that an estimate is good? An estimate would be good if the resulting value of the estimation error-- that is the difference between the estimated value and the true value-- if that difference is small.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMHJPEcoC08#t=552.94s
L15.8 Trajectory Estimation Illustration	One starts with a linear model, in which we have a linear relation between the variables that are unknown and the observations, but where also the observations are corrupted by noise. One makes certain normality and independence assumptions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTKRruMNOHw#t=622.1s
L24.2 Introduction to Markov Processes	In this lecture, we introduce Markov chains, a general class of random processes with many applications dealing with the evolution of dynamical systems. They have been used in physics, chemistry, information sciences, queuing theory, internet applications, statistics, finance, games, music, genetics, baseball, history, you name it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ck5dOsPgQ#t=1.09s
L15.3 Estimating a Normal Random Variable in the Presence of Additive Noise	So this is what the estimates are. If we want to talk about estimators, which are now random variables, what would they be? The estimator is a random variable that takes this value whenever capital X takes the value of little x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgICsL7ybWc#t=393.87s
L26.5 Design of a Phone System	Now, what is pi 0? Well, we can find it by using the normalization equation, the summation of pi i equals 1. You use this normalization, replace each pi i by their quantities as a function of pi 0, and then we obtain this equation for pi 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85le_VkEK5A#t=840.26s
L04.4 Combinations	And we keep going all the way to the number of subsets that have exactly n elements. So we're counting zero-element subsets, one-element subsets, all the way up to n. So what we're counting really is the number of all subsets of our given set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_qO7RYBF10#t=545.42s
L08.5 Mean & Variance of the Uniform	So let us now calculate the mean or expected value for the continuous case. The mean is defined as an integral that ranges over the entire real line. On the other hand, we recognize that the density is equal to 0 outside the interval from a to b, and therefore, there is going to be no contribution to the integral from those x's outside that interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXmDp8R8n8U#t=17.8s
L08.2 Probability Density Functions	The letter f will always indicate that we are dealing with a PDF. And the subscript will indicate which random variable we're talking about. We use the probability density function to calculate the probability that X lies in a certain interval-- let's say the interval from a to b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QFpZ3FndBc#t=108.84s
L08.2 Probability Density Functions	These two conditions are all that we need in order to have a legitimate PDF. We can now give a formal definition of what a continuous random variable is. A continuous random variable is a random variable whose probabilities can be described by a PDF according to a formula of this type.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QFpZ3FndBc#t=229.78s
L08.2 Probability Density Functions	And a final consequence of the fact that individual points have 0 length. Using the additivity axiom, the probability that our random variable takes values inside an interval is equal to the probability that our random variable takes a value of a plus the probability that our random variable takes a value of b plus the probability that our random variable is strictly between a and b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QFpZ3FndBc#t=614.03s
L05.8 Expectation	This is the concept of the expected value or expectation or mean of a random variable. It is a single number that provides some kind of summary of a random variable by telling us what it is on the average.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJsO5955ZE#t=17.25s
L05.8 Expectation	More general, if you do not have symmetry, the expected value turns out to be the center of gravity of the PMF. If you think of these bars as having weight, where the weight is proportional to their height, the center of gravity is the point at which you should put your finger if you want to balance that diagram so that it doesn't fall in one direction or the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJsO5955ZE#t=483.06s
L24.8 Recurrent and Transient States	A state is said to be recurrent if starting from that state, no matter where you go, there is always a path to come back. A state is said to be transient if it is not recurrent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSQaYn2h-e8#t=71.7s
L24.8 Recurrent and Transient States	So four cannot be a recurrent state. It is then called a transient state. For the same reason, starting from three, there is the possibility that after doing many transitions around here, eventually, you will end up being in either two and then go to six, or you will eventually be in one and then go to five.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSQaYn2h-e8#t=158.87s
L06.7 Joint PMFs and the Expected Value Rule	And we can find the PMF of this random variable if we know the joint PMF of X and Y. So the PMF, which is the probability that the random variable takes on a specific numerical value, that's the probability that the function of X and Y takes on a specific numerical value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nu97OYx4X4#t=497.78s
L04.9 Multinomial Probabilities	This is one possible outcome. What is the probability of obtaining this particular outcome? The probability of obtaining this particular outcome is, using independence, the probability that we obtain color 1 in the first trial, color 1 in the second trial, color 3 in the third trial, color 1 in the fourth trial, color 2 in the next trial, color 2 in the next trial, color 1 in the last trial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A_H1eHbOCY#t=332.53s
L04.9 Multinomial Probabilities	And the cardinalities of those subsets are the numbers that appear here in the type of the sequence. The conclusion is that a sequence of certain type is equivalent, or can be alternatively specified, by giving you a partition over this set of tosses, which is the set from 1 up to n, how many trials we've had, a partition into subsets of certain sizes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A_H1eHbOCY#t=523.299s
L14.5 Discrete Parameter, Discrete Observation	Let us now discuss in some more detail what it takes to carry out Bayesian inference, when both random variables are discrete. The unknown parameter, Theta, is a random variable that takes values in the discrete set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYg2je06Cpg#t=0.58s
L14.5 Discrete Parameter, Discrete Observation	One way of coming up with an estimate is to use the maximum a posteriori of probability rule, which looks for that value of theta that has the largest posterior, or conditional, probability.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYg2je06Cpg#t=63.55s
L14.5 Discrete Parameter, Discrete Observation	In this example, it is this value, so our estimate is going to be equal to 2. An alternative way of coming up with an estimate could be the LMS rule, which calculates an estimate equal to the conditional expectation of the unknown parameter, given the observation that we have made.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYg2je06Cpg#t=75.53s
L14.5 Discrete Parameter, Discrete Observation	More generally, the probability of error of a particular estimate is the sum of the probabilities of the other values of Theta. And if we want to keep the probability of error small, we want to keep the sum of the probabilities of the other values small, which means we want to pick an estimate for which its own probability is large.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYg2je06Cpg#t=211.26s
L07.6 Independence & Expectations	And we also know that there are some exceptions where we do get equality. This is the case where we are dealing with linear functions of one or more random variables. Note that this last property is always true and does not require any independence assumptions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4nGGs0m7lo#t=14.43s
L18.2 The Markov Inequality	We may be interested in saying something about the probability of an extreme event. By extreme event, we mean that some random variable takes a very large value. If we can calculate that probability exactly, then, of course, everything is fine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjYanZ1nsZg#t=20.14s
L18.2 The Markov Inequality	However, the event that X is larger than or equal to 3 is smaller than the event that the absolute value of X is larger than or equal to 3. That is, we take this blue event and we also add this green event, and we say that the probability of the blue event is less than or equal to the probability of the blue together with the green event, which is the event that the absolute value of X is larger than or equal to 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjYanZ1nsZg#t=473.68s
L10.8 Bayes Rule Variations	We then take one of the terms involved here and send it to the other side. We obtain this expression, which is the Bayes rule. What [do] we have here? We want to calculate the conditional distribution of X which we typically call the posterior.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSrVCCBOeg4#t=104.479s
L11.5 The PDF of a General Function	So 1 less than y less than or equal to 2. And now we start with our two-step program. We want to find the CDF of Y, namely, the probability that capital Y takes a value less than or equal to a certain little y in this range.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-AzW70e2M0#t=374.95s
L08.6 Exponential Random Variables	Generally, it models the time that we have to wait until something happens. In the discrete case, the geometric random variable models the time until we see a success for the first time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOFtMqCxZt0#t=456.49s
L11.3 A Linear Function of a Continuous Random Variable	The trick is to work with CDFs. So let us try to find the CDF of Y. The CDF of the random variable Y is defined as the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11iF2ovjKOg#t=384.34s
L04.1 Lecture Overview	We will see shortly what all of these terms mean. In the process we will solve a number of example problems, and we will also derive the formula for the binomial probabilities, the probabilities that describe the number of heads in a sequence of independent coin tosses.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poeHeiiiLKI#t=128.139s
L16.4 LMS Performance Evaluation	So the conditional variance is the optimal mean squared error, the mean squared error that you obtain when you use this particular estimate. And it's the value that you would report to your boss if you were asked how good is the estimate that you're giving me.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrVM6MGnGo#t=81.85s
L16.4 LMS Performance Evaluation	And in our more abstract notation, it is just the expectation of the conditional variance. The conditional variance, the abstract conditional variance, is a random variable that takes this value whenever capital X happens to be equal to little x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrVM6MGnGo#t=160.31s
L01.10 Interpretations & Uses of Probabilities	Now, whether your predictions and decisions will be any good will depend on whether you have chosen a good model. Have you chosen a model that's provides a good enough representation of the real world? How do you make sure that this is the case? There's a whole field, the field of statistics, whose purpose is to complement probability theory by using data to come up with good models.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGTX2ypzKI#t=165.0s
L02.1 Lecture Overview	And this is the subject of this lecture. We will start with a formal definition of conditional probabilities together with the motivation behind this particular definition. We will then proceed to develop three tools that rely on conditional probabilities, including the Bayes rule, which provides a systematic way for incorporating new evidence into a probability model.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5y6fy5iUtg#t=57.66s
L02.1 Lecture Overview	In particular, the Bayes rule is the foundation for the field of inference. It is a guide on how to process data and make inferences about unobserved quantities or phenomena. As such, it is a tool that is used all the time, all over science and engineering.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5y6fy5iUtg#t=107.759s
L20.6 Confidence Intervals for the Estimation of the Mean	In order to obtain numerical values for the endpoints of the confidence interval, we need to know sigma, the standard deviation of the random variables that we are observing. But if we do not know the value of sigma, then we may have to do some additional work.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mImHCY0A3a0#t=247.62s
L16.8 Properties of the LMS Estimation Error	Let us define the error, which is the difference between the estimator and the random variable that we are trying to estimate. Let us start with some observations. What is the expected value of our estimator? Well, using the law of iterated expectations, the expectation of a conditional expectation is the same as the unconditional expectation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlO3xyeaZME#t=18.83s
L18.1 Lecture Overview	In this lecture, we develop the weak law of large numbers. Loosely speaking, the weak law of large numbers says that if we have a sequence of independent random variables with the same distribution, then the average of these random variables, which is called the sample mean, approaches the expected value of the distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0i6bWxmRY#t=0.5s
L18.1 Lecture Overview	Finally, we will have to deal with a technical issue. The weak law of large numbers talks about the convergence of a random variable to a number. For this to make sense, we need to define an appropriate notion of convergence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0i6bWxmRY#t=88.78s
L15.5 The Mean Squared Error	The estimator is a random variable that processes the data and comes up with an estimate. So although it is a random variable, once I tell you the value of the observations, the value of this random variable has been completely determined.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CipR1Jypkz0#t=82.72s
L15.5 The Mean Squared Error	And what we obtain is that 1 over 2 alpha, when alpha is given by this expression, is equal to this expression here. And so we have found the conditional variance, the variance of the posterior distribution of Theta given the data that we have available in our hands.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CipR1Jypkz0#t=224.68s
L26.9 Gambler's Ruin	So we have n plus 1 states. This is the state where she loses all her money. This is the state where she has i amount of money before the next betting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne2lmAZI4-I#t=109.93s
L26.9 Gambler's Ruin	And here, this is the state n where she reaches her goal and she can leave. In terms of the transition probability, assuming that you are at a given time in that state, that means that you have i money in your pocket, and you play the next bet.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne2lmAZI4-I#t=122.02s
L25.11 Birth-Death Processes - Part II	So at each point in time, if we are somewhere in the middle, you have probability p of moving up, and probability q of moving down. Define rho to be the ratio of p over q.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdAsNQVdaNk#t=76.39s
L24.4 Discrete-Time Finite-State Markov Chains	Let us now abstract from our previous example and provide a general definition of what a discrete time, finite state Markov chain is. First, central in the description of a Markov process is the concept of a state, which describes the current situation of a system we are interested in.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQnmrHbbms#t=0.82s
S18.2 Jensen's Inequality	Convexity means that this value is below that value. Or in other words, whenever I take two points on this curve and join them by a segment, then the function lies underneath that segment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDJFLfmyb20#t=236.84s
L09.7 Joint PDFs	We also need to model the relation between the two random variables, and this is done through a joint PDF, which is the continuous analog of the joint PMF. We will use this notation to indicate joint PDFs where we use f to indicate that we're dealing with a density.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4QYcoxuLHE#t=20.25s
L09.7 Joint PDFs	And this will be done in analogy with the discrete setting. In the discrete setting, the probability that the pair of random variables falls inside a certain set is just the sum of the probabilities of all of the possible pairs inside that particular set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4QYcoxuLHE#t=79.27s
L09.7 Joint PDFs	The joint PDF tells us how this unit of probability is spread over the entire continuous two-dimensional plane. And we use it, we use the joint PDF, to calculate the probability of a certain set by finding the volume under the joint PDF that lies on top of that set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4QYcoxuLHE#t=118.63s
L09.7 Joint PDFs	For joint continuity, we want the probability to be really spread over two dimensions. Probability is not allowed to be concentrated on a one-dimensional set. On the other hand, in this example, the probability is concentrated on a one-dimensional set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4QYcoxuLHE#t=536.37s
L09.10 Joint CDFs	And conversely, we can recover the PDF from the CDF by differentiating. There is something similar that happens for the case of multiple random variables, as well. We can define the joint CDF as the probability that X and Y, the pair X-Y, takes values that are below certain numbers, little x and little y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVVbUKstn8A#t=18.64s
L20.1 Lecture Overview	Recall that in the Bayesian framework, unknown quantities are viewed as random variables that have a certain prior distribution. In contrast, in the classical setting an unknown quantity is viewed as a non-random constant that just happens to be unknown.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5rZKt3SgNM#t=15.54s
L20.1 Lecture Overview	Now, the sample mean provides us a point estimate for the unknown theta, but does not tell us how accurate that estimate is. To give a sense of the accuracy involved, we introduce the concept of a confidence interval, which is an interval that has high probability of containing the true theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5rZKt3SgNM#t=71.01s
S05.1 Supplement: Functions	For any element x, it tells us what the corresponding element y is. However, when the set A is an infinite set it is not clear what we might mean by saying a table, an infinite table, whereas this definition in terms of ordered pairs still applies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwd4ABlO0Dc#t=211.56s
L09.8 From The Joint to the Marginal	Replace sums by integrals, and replace PMFs by PDFs. But a proof of this formula is actually instructive. So let us start by first finding the CDF of X. The CDF of X is, by definition, the probability that the random variable X takes a value less than or equal to a certain number little x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8DKVKfWU_Q#t=32.9s
L09.8 From The Joint to the Marginal	So the total volume sitting on top of this little set is going to be the base, the area of the base, which is the area of A intersection S times the height of the PDF at those places.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8DKVKfWU_Q#t=259.05s
L04.6 A Coin Tossing Example	We want to calculate conditional probabilities. And this places us in a conditional universe. We have the conditioning event B, which is some set. And conditional probabilities are probabilities defined inside this set B and define the probabilities, the conditional probabilities of the different outcomes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f9EfEga4Oo#t=402.68s
L03.2 A Coin Tossing Example	So we're talking about this particular outcome here. According to the multiplication rule, to find the probability of a particular final outcome, we multiply probabilities and conditional probabilities along the path that leads to this particular outcome.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZKUmNvCjis#t=118.99s
L03.2 A Coin Tossing Example	We use the definition of conditional probabilities. The conditional probability is the ratio, first, of the probability that both events happen, divided by the probability of the conditioning event, which is the probability of 1 head.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZKUmNvCjis#t=289.74s
L02.5 A Radar Example and Three Basic Tools	Let us call Event A the event that an airplane is indeed flying up there, and we have two possibilities. Either Event A occurs, or the complement of A occurs, in which case nothing is flying up there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL31gpFdarc#t=49.42s
L10.7 Independent Normals	If we look at the unit circle in xy space, which is the set of points at which x squared plus y squared is equal to 1, then, on that circle, the PDF takes a constant value because this quantity is constant on that circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOQxeYGOIag#t=74.9s
L10.7 Independent Normals	Remember that contour is the set of points where the quadratic takes a constant value. And by consequence, the joint PDF also takes a constant value. If you have set this quadratic to a constant, what you have is the equation that describes an ellipse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOQxeYGOIag#t=163.71s
L01.5 Simple Properties of Probabilities	By disjoint here we mean that the intersection of any two of these events is the empty set. We will prove this for the case of three events and then the argument generalizes for the case where we're taking the union of k disjoint events, where k is any finite number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyLg_I1oFY#t=98.69s
L01.5 Simple Properties of Probabilities	We start as follows. Let us look at the sample space and a subset of that sample space. Call it A. And consider the complement of that subset. The complement is the set of all elements that do not belong to the set A. So a set together with its complement make up everything, which is the entire sample space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTyLg_I1oFY#t=171.31s
L25.3 Markov Chain Review	These are the simplest cases and are the best to build our intuition. So the state space is discrete, here, finite with m states, and time is discrete. That is, at any discrete point in time, the process is in one of these m states and let's say here, at any given time s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cph71QcwHeQ#t=15.67s
L25.3 Markov Chain Review	So the defining feature of a Markov chain is the Markov property. And the Markov property essentially says that the past is not really important in order to predict the future, as long as you know where you are now.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cph71QcwHeQ#t=145.63s
L12.11 Correlations Matter	Suppose, however, that your assumption is wrong, and that actually the different Xi's are correlated with each other. And suppose that the correlation is pretty high, 0.9. Essentially, this means that the real estate market in one state is strongly related to the behavior of the market in another state.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-gN0dDHU-4#t=204.07s
L04.2 The Counting Principle	n factorial is the product of all integers from 1 all the way up to n. And in particular, the number of permutations of n elements is equal to n factorial. Let us now consider another example.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k8WU-KB0rk#t=506.3s
L10.1 Lecture Overview	This will be the methodological foundation for when, later in this course, we dive into the subject of inference. The Bayes rule allows us to revise our beliefs about a random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQukfQgIIqw#t=62.55s
L18.8 Related Topics	Another type of approximation on this tail probability can be obtained through the central limit theorem, which will actually be the next topic that we will be studying. Very loosely speaking, the central limit theorem tells us that the random variable M sub n, which is the sample mean, behaves as if it were a normal random variable with the mean and the variance that it should have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBqEF1cB7nE#t=102.259s
L18.8 Related Topics	For some, it will not happen. We will say that we have convergence with probability one if this event has probability equal to 1. That is, there is probability one, that is, essential certainty, that when an outcome of the experiment is obtained, the resulting sequence of values of the random variables Yn will converge to the value of the random variable Y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBqEF1cB7nE#t=239.52s
L03.10 The King's Sibling	And we're restricted to a smaller universe with only three possible outcomes. Our new universe is this green universe, which includes all outcomes that have at least one boy, so that we can get a king.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPWyElxtk-8#t=155.05s
L20.9 Maximum Likelihood Estimation	And this looks very similar to what is happening here, where we take this expression and maximize it over all thetas. So operationally, maximum likelihood estimation is the same as Bayesian estimation, in which we find the peak of the posterior for the special case where we're using constant or a flat prior.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgCBmERwZlI#t=139.75s
L20.9 Maximum Likelihood Estimation	Finally, one last important property is that the maximum likelihood estimator is what is called an asymptotically efficient estimator. That is, it is the best possible estimator in the sense that it achieves the smallest possible variance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgCBmERwZlI#t=356.01s
S09.1 Buffon's Needle & Monte Carlo Simulation	First, we need to model the experiment-- the probabilistic experiment-- mathematically. That is, we need to define an appropriate sample space, define some relevant random variables, choose an appropriate probability law, identify the event of interest, and then calculate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSrPJe7y9oA#t=91.67s
L23.8 Random Incidence in a Non-Poisson Process	Now, you show up at a random time. And by random we mean a time that's completely uncoordinated with the arrival process. You show up at some point in time, and you look at the interarrival interval in which you fall.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS1o7uTaLF0#t=97.38s
L06.2 Variance	We have introduced the concept of expected value or mean, which tells us the average value of a random variable. We will now introduce another quantity, the variance, which quantifies the spread of the distribution of a random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWo1XgAQE5k#t=0.84s
L06.2 Variance	A more intuitive quantity is the square root of the variance, which is called the standard deviation. It has the same units as the random variable and captures the width of the distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWo1XgAQE5k#t=272.59s
L06.2 Variance	So let Y be X plus some constant b. And let us just define nu to be the expected value of Y, which, using linearity of expectations, is the expected value of X plus b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWo1XgAQE5k#t=320.47s
L01.4 Probability Axioms	"If we have two sets, let's say a set A, and another set, another set B, we use this particular notation, which we read as ""A intersection B"" to refer to the collection of elements that belong to both A and B. So in this picture, the intersection of A and B is this shaded set."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA83XtLeVig#t=322.77s
L01.4 Probability Axioms	This is called the additivity axiom. So it says that we can add probabilities of different sets when those two sets are disjoint. In some sense we can think of probability as being one pound of some substance which is spread over our sample space and the probability of A is how much of that substance is sitting on top of a set A. So what this axiom is saying is that the total amount of that substance sitting on top of A and B is how much is sitting on top of A plus how much is sitting on top of B. And that is the case whenever the sets A and B are disjoint from each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA83XtLeVig#t=441.7s
L13.5 Forecast Revisions	Now, time goes by, and we're sitting now in the beginning of February or the end of January. At that time, you obtain some new information, which is the value, little y, of a random variable, capital Y. What should your new forecast be? Well, once you have this information in your hands, your new forecast should be the expected value of x, given the specific available information that you have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T34yGp4T7A#t=56.22s
L13.5 Forecast Revisions	It's random. It depends on what capital Y would end up being. My revised forecast is a random variable, the expected value of X given Y, which will take this particular numerical value if it turns out the random variable Y takes a specific value, little y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T34yGp4T7A#t=107.67s
L17.7 LLMS with Multiple Observations	We have presented the complete solution to the liner least mean squares estimation problem, when we want to estimate a certain unknown random variable on the basis of a different random variable X that we get to observe.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipSdsosGJBs#t=1.0s
L17.7 LLMS with Multiple Observations	And then we pose the problem of finding the best choices of these coefficients a1 up to a n and b. What does it mean to find the best choices? It means that if we fix certain choices, we obtain an estimator, we look at the difference between the estimator and the quantity we're trying to estimate, take the square, and then take the expectation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipSdsosGJBs#t=34.28s
L21.6 Example: The Distribution of a Busy Period	Time is discrete, divided into slots. We have a server that receives tasks to process. Tasks received gets processed in the same time slot. So slots are divided into busy ones-- those are the slots during which a task gets processed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kdv3r-YgK0#t=14.91s
L21.6 Example: The Distribution of a Busy Period	And idle slots-- these are the slots during which there is no task to be processed. We assume that the process of job arrivals is described by a Bernoulli process with some known parameter p.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kdv3r-YgK0#t=33.29s
L14.4 The Bayesian Inference Framework	This is the prior distribution. This is what we believe about Theta before we obtain any data. And then, we obtain some data, which are some observation. That observation is a random variable, but when the process gets realized, we observe an actual value, numerical value, of this random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w_4QcvBYII#t=32.98s
L14.4 The Bayesian Inference Framework	What we have produced here is an estimate. I gave you the conditional PDF or conditional PMF, and you tell me a number. This number, the estimate, is obtained by starting with the data, doing some processing to the data, and eventually, coming up with a numerical value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w_4QcvBYII#t=451.61s
L14.4 The Bayesian Inference Framework	In any case, it is important to keep this distinction in mind. The estimator is the rule that we use to process the data, and it is equivalent to a certain random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w_4QcvBYII#t=526.39s
L14.4 The Bayesian Inference Framework	An estimate is the specific numerical value that we get when the data take a specific numerical value. So if little x is the numerical value of capital X, in that case, little theta hat is the numerical value of the estimator capital Theta hat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w_4QcvBYII#t=538.81s
S13.1 Conditional Expectation Properties	This was our definition of the concept of the abstract conditional expectation as a random variable. This is the random variable that takes this specific numerical value whenever the random variable, capital Y, takes the value, little y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BttG14vI7c#t=121.61s
L06.4 Conditional PMFs & Expectations Given an Event	Finally, as we discussed some time ago, a conditional probability model is just another probability model, except that it applies to a new situation. So any fact about probability models-- any theorem that we derive-- must remain true in the conditional model as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_KBeHiUDiY#t=150.77s
L06.4 Conditional PMFs & Expectations Given an Event	Suppose that now somebody tells us that event A has occurred, where event A is that the random variable X takes values in the range 2, 3, 4. What happens now? What is the conditional PMF? In the conditional model, we are told that the value of 1 did not occur, so this probability is going to be 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_KBeHiUDiY#t=255.97s
L06.4 Conditional PMFs & Expectations Given an Event	The expected value of the random variable X in the conditional universe-- that is, the conditional expectation-- is just the ordinary expectation but applied to the conditional model. In this conditional model, by symmetry, the expected value will have to be 3, the midpoint of the distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_KBeHiUDiY#t=311.66s
L06.4 Conditional PMFs & Expectations Given an Event	We can calculate this variance using once more the formula for the variance of a uniform distribution, but we can also do it directly. So the variance is the expected value of the squared distance from the mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_KBeHiUDiY#t=350.77s
L12.8 The Correlation Coefficient	Another difficulty is that if X and Y are in units, let's say, of meters, then the covariance will have units of meters squared. And this is hard to interpret. A much more informative quantity is the so-called correlation coefficient, which is a dimensionless version of the covariance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTs6Zhc2S1M#t=20.99s
L16.3 LMS Estimation of One Random Variable Based on Another	And now that we have the posterior distribution of Theta, we would like to come up with a point estimate. How do we do it? Remember our earlier conclusion. If we do not have any observations, if we live in a universe where we have a distribution of Theta and we want a point estimate, the optimal, the one that minimizes the mean squared error, is the expected value of our random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R4IzkWSNgI#t=61.01s
L16.3 LMS Estimation of One Random Variable Based on Another	But now we live in a different universe, in a universe where we have a conditional distribution of Theta. We want to minimize the conditional mean squared error, because this is the mean squared error that applies to this conditional universe in which we have obtained a particular observation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R4IzkWSNgI#t=84.86s
L16.3 LMS Estimation of One Random Variable Based on Another	So to summarize, the conditional expectation of Theta, viewed as a random variable, as an estimator, what we call the LMS estimator of Theta, has the property that it minimizes the mean squared error over all possible alternative estimators.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R4IzkWSNgI#t=524.049s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	We will now define the notion of a random variable. Very loosely speaking, a random variable is a numerical quantity that takes random values. But what does this mean? We want to be a little more precise and I'm going to introduce the idea through an example.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=0.7s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	Suppose that our sample space is a set of students labeled according to their names. Or for simplicity, let's just label them as a, b, c, and d. Our probabilistic experiment is to pick a student at random according to some probability law and then record their weight in kilograms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=17.14s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	The weight of a particular student is a number, little w. But let us think of the abstract concept of weight, something that we will denote by capital W. Weight is an object whose value is determined once you tell me the outcome of the experiment, once you tell me which student was picked.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=67.9s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	Or if the outcome of the experiment was student c, then we would record the height of that student. And let's say it turns out to be 1.8. Once again, height with a capital H is an abstract object, a function whose value is determined once you tell me the outcome of the experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=206.69s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	And so the body mass index is really a function of which particular outcome was selected. Let us now abstract from the previous discussion. We have seen that random variables are abstract objects that associate a specific value, a particular number, to any particular outcome of a probabilistic experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=304.33s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	So in that sense, random variables are functions from the sample space to the real numbers. They are numerical functions, but as numerical functions they can either take discrete values, for example the integers, or they can take continuous values, let's say on the real line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=330.7s
L05.2 Definition of Random Variables	As an example, we could think of two random variables, X and Y, associated with the same probabilistic experiment. And then define a random variable, let's say X plus Y. What does that mean? X plus Y is a random variable that takes the value little x plus little y when the random variable capital X takes the value little x and capital Y takes the value little y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPpai_9jI#t=474.44s
L24.1 Lecture Overview	In this lecture, we introduce Markov chains, a general class of random processes with many applications dealing with the evolution of dynamical systems. As opposed to the Bernoulli and Poisson processes, which are memoryless in a sense that the future does not depend on the past, Markov chains are more elaborate, as they allow some dependencies between different times.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBiYeL4qD2M#t=0.5s
S01.5 Infinite Series	So it's an infinite sequence. And we want to add the terms of that sequence together. We denote the resulting sum of that infinity of terms using this notation. But what does that mean exactly? What is the formal definition of an infinite series? Well, the infinite series is defined as the limit, as n goes to infinity, of the finite series in which we add only the first n terms in the series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYe4OZVCnIs#t=17.41s
S01.8 Countable and Uncountable Sets	A set will be called countable if its elements can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the positive integers. This means that we look at the elements of that set, and we take one element-- we call it the first element.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqocbJ-FPo0#t=33.92s
S01.8 Countable and Uncountable Sets	Now for a more subtle example. Let us look at all rational numbers within the range between 0 and 1. What do we mean by rational numbers? We mean those numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqocbJ-FPo0#t=221.49s
S01.8 Countable and Uncountable Sets	And so we conclude that the set of all rational numbers is itself a countable set. So what kind of set would be uncountable? An uncountable set, by definition, is a set that is not countable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqocbJ-FPo0#t=302.09s
L07.3 Conditional Expectation & the Total Expectation Theorem	So suppose that the sample space has been partitioned into n, disjoint scenarios. The total probability theorem tells us that the probability of the event that random variable X takes on a value little x, can be found by taking the probabilities of this event under each one of the possible scenarios.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJAG4EzSQZA#t=129.36s
L20.10 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Examples	According to the maximum likelihood methodology, the first step is to write down the likelihood function. This is the probability of obtaining this particular piece of data if the true parameter is theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00krscK7iBA#t=41.81s
L20.10 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Examples	But both the mean and the variance are unknown, and we want to estimate them on the basis of these observations. The first step is to write down the likelihood function. That is the probability density function for the vector of observations given some set of parameters.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00krscK7iBA#t=280.54s
L20.10 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Examples	So this is the likelihood function in this case. This is the probability density of obtaining a particular vector X of observations when we have these particular parameters. We would like to maximize this function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00krscK7iBA#t=323.77s
L18.7 Convergence in Probability Examples	The distribution remains spread out over the entire unit interval. But let us look now at some related random variables. Let us define Yn to be the minimum of the first n of the X's that we get.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l9y2Kv8VHw#t=186.01s
L18.7 Convergence in Probability Examples	And we are done. But we need to check that this quantity becomes small no matter what epsilon is. So now, let us consider taking a small epsilon that is some number that's less than or equal to 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l9y2Kv8VHw#t=334.15s
L20.3 The Sample Mean and Some Terminology	We assume that we do not know the value of the mean, and we want to estimate it. The most natural way of estimating the mean is to form the sample mean, that is, we take the n observations and take their average.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuXDb9B3y0M#t=30.56s
L16.1 Lecture Overview	We have seen so far two ways of estimating an unknown parameter. We can use the maximum a posteriori probability estimate, or we can use the conditional expectation. That is, the mean of the posterior distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlsVWPWIxHI#t=0.61s
L05.4 Bernoulli & Indicator Random Variables	We now want to introduce some examples of random variables, and we will start with the simplest conceivable random variable-- a random variable that takes the values of 0 or 1, with certain given probabilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8L9kRGSvSY#t=0.31s
L05.4 Bernoulli & Indicator Random Variables	This is PMF notation. This is the equivalent probabilistic notation. This is the probability that the random variable takes a value 1. Now the random variable takes the value of 1 if and only if event A occurs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8L9kRGSvSY#t=135.79s
L22.2 Definition of the Poisson Process	And a second order term is a term that's negligible compared to the first order term when delta is small. More precisely, mathematically, what we mean is that a second order term compared to a first order term goes to 0 as delta goes to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_EGYzqmapc#t=244.62s
16. Portfolio Management	Then you probably go down, back up. Right, so that's your earning. And do they always match well? They don't. So how do you make up the difference? You hope to have a fund, an investment on the side, which can generate those cash flows to balance your earning versus your spending.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TJQhQ2GZ0Y#t=965.97s
16. Portfolio Management	So that was a good portfolio, but then obviously in 2008 when the equity market crashed, the bond market, the government bond hybrid market, had a huge rally. And so that made people question that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TJQhQ2GZ0Y#t=2986.96s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	As we know the counterparty is a risk. Whenever there's a risk, we could put a price on that risk. Credit valuation adjustment, CVA, essentially is the price of a counterparty credit risk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=260.37s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	Mainly mark-to-market risks, of course, include default risk too. It is an adjustment to the price of mark-to-market from a counterparty-default-free model, the broker quote. So people know, there's a broker quote.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=278.69s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	CVA risk, as you may know, has been a very important risk, especially since the crisis in 2008. During the crisis, a significant financial loss actually is coming from CVA loss, meaning mark-to-market loss due to counterparties' future default.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=387.17s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	MPE means mean positive exposure, meaning only our receivable sides when the counterparty owes us money, and times the counterparty CDS par spread, times duration. The wider the spread the more likely the counterparty will default, the more we need to charge on the CVA.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=885.74s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	And this is how much collateral we hold against this portfolio. So the net receivable, the net amount, where the future value is greater than the collateral, is our sort of exposure, how much the counterparty would owe us.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=1010.68s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	So Berkshire essentially saw their credit spread widening a lot more than they had hoped for, than they had anticipated. And later on, they found out it was due to CVA hedging, CVA risk management.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=2382.5s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	Essentially, that is y_T over beta(t) is a martingale. This is essentially the Harrison-Pliska martingale no-arbitrage theorem. It says for two traded assets with no intermediate cash flows, satisfying technical conditions, the ratio is a martingale.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=3185.48s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	Forward LIBOR-- this is the forward LIBOR-- essentially, it's a ratio of two zero-coupon bonds. So naturally, we know it's a martingale under of the numeraire asset. So essentially it's a forward measure up to the payment on the forward LIBOR.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=3258.46s
26. Introduction to Counterparty Credit Risk	Then we can assume log-normal just for example. We don't have to, we can use CEV, we can use [INAUDIBLE] stochastic volatility. The starting point is martingale, identifying the martingale measure and then perform martingale representation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKmcRfE3I6E#t=4427.99s
13. Commodity Models	So this is the graph of futures contracts, futures prices, oil futures prices on January 15, 2009. Futures contract is simply the contract that allows you to buy today-- let's say, in January-- the barrel of oil for delivery in some future time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=207.51s
13. Commodity Models	What they will do-- they will, on January 1st, they will sell something that is called August-December spread option. You heard the word option, right? Option is characterized by the payout at expiration.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=814.03s
13. Commodity Models	Assume that you are the manager of the merchant power plant. Merchant means that you decide when to run it, or not run it. You run it to maximize the profit of this power plant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=2604.41s
13. Commodity Models	So correlation is not a number. It's dependent the heat rate in the market. Remember heat rate is the efficiency of the power plant that are running in the market. Depending on the efficiency, you may have very high correlation or low correlation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=3305.75s
13. Commodity Models	So it's clear that in order to-- we want to kind of start with Brownian motion, geometric Brownian motion, try to maybe modify it a little bit. So what is spike? Spike means that just things go up, and then they're pulled back.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=3388.62s
13. Commodity Models	So you introduce right now so-called regime switching. So it means that all the parameters change, so you introduce the kind of the high price level, low price level, parameters change. And now we're getting to the example that we discussed in the first half.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=3494.74s
13. Commodity Models	The other guy is sending similar things. The auctioneer-- there is an auctioneer, organization called independent system operator, ISO. They collect all these bids. They know what demand will be tomorrow. They collect, and then knowing this demand, they will-- first of all, they will sort out all the bids in the most optimal way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=3755.23s
13. Commodity Models	The final price is the highest, basically highest price that is necessary to meet the demand. So if the demand is 600, so this will be the price. If it's 800, this will be the price.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=3815.84s
13. Commodity Models	So now we have-- we modeled the evolution of temperature, evolution of demand, evolution of fuel, evolution of the outages. Now we can construct the generation stack. So remember, the generation was this curve, this curve that was a function of demand, but also the fraction of the outages, variable costs, and so on, and the fuel, the vector fuels.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmehlS-8b3Y#t=4416.97s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	The amount we paid for out of our pocket is the equity. The ratio of this to this is called leverage among other things. All right? If I'm this company. I have this much stuff and I bought it with this much debt, and this much equity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=892.29s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	Variance, the expected value of x_i minus x bar-- I love these thick chalks-- squared. And it's the sum of x_i minus x bar squared over n minus 1. It's a measure of dispersion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=1141.39s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	I take the square root of the variance, which is the standard deviation, or the volatility. When I'm doing it with a data set, I usually refer to it as the standard deviation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=1222.29s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	When I'm referring to the standard deviation of the distribution, I usually call it the standard error. Is that a law or is that just common parlance? PROFESSOR: Both. The standard error is typically for something that's random, like an estimate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=1232.22s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	And then when you take the intermediate courses, they say, no, don't use standard deviation when you mean standard error. And you'll get points off on your exam for that, right? All right, so, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, also called the volatility.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=1257.42s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	Roughly 3/4 of your financial time series will have fat tails. They will also have time series properties, they won't be true random walks. True random walks says that I don't know whether it's going to go up or down based on the data I have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=1671.252s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	One basis point is 1/100th of a percent in yield. Duration is the half life, essentially, of my cash flow. What's the weighted expected time to owe my cash flows? If my duration is 7.9 years, my PV01 is probably about $790 per million.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=2071.46s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	Put a stone on my grave or something. All right so covariance. Covariance tells me some measure of when x moves, how far does y move? [? Or ?] for any other asset? Could I have a piece of your cookie? I hardly had lunch.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=2669.88s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	It was a pseudo-random number generator. I didn't know, I was 24. Anyway. quasi-random numbers, it's sort of a way of imposing some order on your random numbers. You random numbers, one particular set of draws may not have enough draws in a particular area to give you the numbers you want.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=3869.35s
7. Value At Risk (VAR) Models	So I factor this matrix, and then I take this, which is the square root matrix, which is my transpose of my eigenvector matrix and diagonal matrix contain the square root of my eigenvalues.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WaNz9mPeY#t=4100.02s
2. Linear Algebra	That will be our Av, which is equal to lambda v. So eigenvectors are those special vectors which when applied this linear transformation just get scaled by some amount, where that amount is exactly lambda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtmGy-wfE4#t=619.59s
2. Linear Algebra	Let me iterate through this a little bit. What is an orthonormal matrix? It's a matrix defined by the relation U times U transposed is equal to the identity. What is a diagonal matrix? It's a matrix whose nonzero entries are all on the diagonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtmGy-wfE4#t=753.54s
2. Linear Algebra	And eigenvectors have this geometrical meaning where-- a vector is an eigenvector, if the linear transformation defined by A just scales that vector. So for our setting, the real good matrices are the matrices which can be broken down into these directions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtmGy-wfE4#t=865.31s
2. Linear Algebra	Second part, there exists an eigenvector, a positive eigenvector with positive entries, corresponding to lambda 0. So the eigenvector corresponding to this lambda 0 has positive entries. And the third part is lambda_0 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 1, for those who know what it is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtmGy-wfE4#t=3916.81s
3. Probability Theory	So what is this? A probability mass function is a function from the sample space to non-negative reals such that the sum over all points in the domain equals 1. The probability distribution is very similar.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XFM8YLccg#t=152.19s
3. Probability Theory	And all of these-- normal, log-normal, Poisson, and exponential, and a lot more can be grouped into a family of distributions called exponential family. So a distribution is called to be in an exponential family-- A distribution belongs to exponential family if there exists a theta, a vector that parametrizes the distribution such that the probability density function for this choice of parameter theta can be written as h of x times c of theta times the exponent of sum from i equal 1 to k-- Yes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XFM8YLccg#t=1556.55s
3. Probability Theory	And a good way to study all the moments together in one function is a moment-generating function. So this moment-generating function encodes all the k-th moments of a random variable. So it contains all the statistical information of a random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XFM8YLccg#t=2000.6s
3. Probability Theory	That will be our first topic. Our second topic will be we want to study its long-term or large-scale behavior. So for example, assume that you have a normal distribution-- one random variable with normal distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XFM8YLccg#t=2038.05s
3. Probability Theory	And you at least get the spirit of what's happening. Now let's move on to the next topic-- central limit theorem. So weak law of large numbers says that if you have IID random variables, 1 over n times sum over X_i's converges to mu, the mean, in some weak sense.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XFM8YLccg#t=3791.35s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	DENIS GOROKHOV: So I work at Morgan Stanley. I run corporate treasury strategies at Morgan Stanley. So corporate treasury is the business unit that is responsible for issuing and risk management of Morgan Stanley debt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=21.037s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	So the so the general idea of pricing derivatives is that one starts from some stochastic process. So in this example here, it's probably like the simplest possible-- nevertheless a very instructive-- model, which is essentially like these [INAUDIBLE] Black-Scholes formalism, which is where we have the stock, which follows the log-normal dynamics.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=359.92s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	So it's all like government-- it's kind of yield implied from the government bonds. But usually, all the derivatives are linked to another very famous rate, which is called LIBOR. And LIBOR-- roughly speaking, it's a short-term rate at which financial institutions in London borrow money from each other on an unsecured basis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=3132.23s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	And it's all kinds of derivatives linked to this LIBOR rate. For example, you can talk about a swaption. What is a swaption? Swaption is a derivative to enter an interest rate swap in the future.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=3211.29s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	Here, this is basically the same idea. If you're here today, at sometime in the future you can enter a swap, a kind of contract, which pays various legs and there is some price given for today.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=3237.58s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	And there are also all kinds of false derivatives. You can talk about rates. Basically you can buy or sell options on a particular LIBOR rate. Or there's also cancel-able swaps, which basically are you can enter a swap, but if you don't want to pay, like, let's say, high rate anymore, you can cancel it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=3250.15s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	So corporations issue bonds, financial instruments to raise capital. It's, again, very similar to the US treasuries. And so you give them $100 and they pay you 5% < every year. And then let's say in 10 years, if it's a 10 year bond, they are supposed to give your money back.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=4044.51s
24. HJM Model for Interest Rates and Credit	So if you have a risky bond, then in order to protect from default you can go, let's say to a bank, and buy a credit default swap. It basically means that if you hold a bond and default happens, then the seller of this protection will compensate you for the loss.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Jn1VrqjWI#t=4198.49s
9. Volatility Modeling	So they're independent and identically distributed normal random variables. And the likelihood function can be maximized at the maximum likelihood parameters. And it's simple to implement the limited information maximum likelihood where one conditions on the first few observations in the time series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=77.437s
9. Volatility Modeling	If you look at the likelihood structure for ARMA models, the density of an outcome at a given time point depends on lags of that dependent variable. So if those are unavailable, then that can be a problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=100.59s
9. Volatility Modeling	There's a famous test called the Dickey-Fuller test, which is essentially to evaluate the time series to see if it's consistent with a random walk. We know that we've been discussing sort of lecture after lecture how simple random walks are non-stationary.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=575.54s
9. Volatility Modeling	And so we can fit the AR(1) model by least squares and define the test statistic to be the estimate of phi minus 1 over its standard error where phi is the least squares estimate and the standard error is the least squares estimate, the standard error of that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=617.64s
9. Volatility Modeling	The p-value is what's the likelihood of getting as extreme or more extreme a value of the test statistic, and the test statistic is evidence against the null hypothesis. So in this case the p-values range basically 0.2726 for the monthly data, which says that basically there is evidence of a unit root in the process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1053.95s
9. Volatility Modeling	Let's see. OK. There's a section on understanding partial auto-correlation coefficients. And let me just state what the partial correlation coefficients are. You have the auto-correlation functions, which are simply the correlations of the time series with lags of its values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1086.53s
9. Volatility Modeling	The partial auto-correlation coefficient is the correlation that's between the time series and say, it's p-th lag that is not explained by all lags lower than p. So it's basically the incremental correlation of the time series variable with the p-th lag after controlling for the others.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1108.19s
9. Volatility Modeling	And then let's see. With this, in section eight here there's a function in R called ar, for autoregressive, which basically will fit all autoregressive models up to a given order and provide diagnostic statistics for that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1135.65s
9. Volatility Modeling	And then there's a property of these Brownian motion and jump-diffusion models which is models with independent increments. Basically you have disjoint increments of the process, basically are independent of each other, which is a key property when there's time dependence in the models.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1284.3s
9. Volatility Modeling	So let's define volatility. OK. In finance it's defined as the annualized standard deviation of the change in price or value of a financial security, or an index. So we're interested in the variability of this process, a price process or a value process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1353.2s
9. Volatility Modeling	And there's a standard for risk analysis called the risk metrics approach, where the approach defines volatility and volatility estimates, historical estimates, just using simple methodologies. And so that's just go through what those are here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=1578.57s
9. Volatility Modeling	All right. So let's turn next to ARCH models. And OK. Just as a bit of motivation, the Geometric Brownian Motion model and also the Poisson Jump Diffusion model are models which assume that volatility over time is essentially stationary.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=3944.39s
9. Volatility Modeling	So the top line there is the ARCH model saying that the variance of the t period return is this weighted average of the past residuals. And then if we simply add a new variable u_t, which is our squared residual minus its variance, to both sides we get the next line, which says that epsilon_t squared follows an autoregression on itself, with the u_t value being the disturbance in that autoregression.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=4164.45s
9. Volatility Modeling	In this case, the data are conditionally independent. The joint density is the product of the density of y_t given the information at t minus 1. So basically the joint probability density is the density at each time point conditional on the past, and then the density times the density of the next time point conditional on the past.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDlbEQz1PQk#t=4415.29s
15. Factor Modeling	And with the factor model we model the t-th value for the i-th object-- whether it's a stock price, futures price, currency-- as a linear function of factors f_1 through f_k. So there's basically like a state-space model for the value of the stochastic process, as it depends on these underlying factors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=107.53s
15. Factor Modeling	The vectors beta_i are termed the factor loadings of an asset. And the epsilon_(i,t)'s are a specific factor of asset i, period t. So in factor modeling, we talk about there being common factors affecting the dynamics of the system, and the factor associated with particular cases are the specific factors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=213.45s
15. Factor Modeling	Psi is a diagonal matrix with the specific variances of the underlying assets. So we have basically epsilon-- the covariance matrix of the epsilons is a diagonal matrix, and the covariance matrix of f is given by this omega_f.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=390.73s
15. Factor Modeling	This is the single-factor model of Sharpe. We went through the capital asset pricing model, how returns on assets and stocks are basically-- the excess return on stock can be modeled in terms as a linear regression on the excess return of the market.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=861.78s
15. Factor Modeling	Utility companies are companies which are very highly regulated. And the profitability of those firms is basically overlooked by the regulators. They don't want the utilities to gouge consumers and make too much profit from delivering power to customers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=1817.749s
15. Factor Modeling	So utilities tend to have fairly low volatility but very consistent returns, which are based on reasonable, from a regulatory standpoint, levels of profitability for those companies. Well with an industry factor model, what we can do is associate factor loadings, which basically are loading each asset in terms of which industry group it's in.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=1841.89s
15. Factor Modeling	But let me highlight where this issue comes up again and again. With portfolio optimization, we went through last time-- for mean-variance optimization, we want to consider a weighting of assets that basically weights the assets by the expected returns, pre-multiplied by the inverse of the covariance matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=2129.18s
15. Factor Modeling	The model likelihood is the joint density of our data given the unknown parameters. And the standard setup actually for statistical factor modeling is to assume independence over time. Now we know that there can be time series dependence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=2948.13s
15. Factor Modeling	The same thing applies. One final thing is with likelihood ratio tests, one can test for whether the linear factor model is a good description of the data. And so with likelihood ratio tests, we compare the likelihood of the data where we fit our unknown parameters, the mean vector alpha and covariance matrix sigma, without any constraints.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=3490.94s
15. Factor Modeling	So this is like a single realization of asset returns in a given time, which has some mean and covariance matrix sigma. The principal components analysis is going to exploit the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=3623.3s
15. Factor Modeling	So we actually are able to decompose our covariance matrix with eigenvalues, eigenvectors. The principal component variables are to consider taking away the mean from the random vector x, alpha. And then consider the weighted average of those de-meaned x's given by the i-th eigenvector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=3668.27s
15. Factor Modeling	And we get sample principal component variables which are-- we basically compute x, the de-meaned vector, or matrix of realizations and pre-multiply that by gamma hat prime, which is the matrix of eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition of the sample covariance matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=3981.06s
15. Factor Modeling	In principal components analysis, there's discussions of the total variability of the data and how well that's explained by principal components. If we have a covariance matrix sigma, the total variance can be defined and is defined as the sum of the diagonal entries.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=4196.78s
15. Factor Modeling	So it's the trace of a covariance matrix. We'll call that the total variance of this multivariate x. That is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues as well. So we have a decomposition of the total variability into the variability of different principal component variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=4217.96s
15. Factor Modeling	And the principal component variables themselves are uncorrelated. You remember the covariance matrix of the principal component variables was the lambda, the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. So the off-diagonal entries are 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=4242.07s
15. Factor Modeling	Basically the time series were all at lower levels from beginning to end on average. The daily volatility is the daily standard deviation. Those vary from 0.0384 up to .0698 for-- is that the three year? And this is the standard deviation of daily yield changes where 1 is like 1%.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=4465.16s
15. Factor Modeling	With principal components analysis, many times I think people focus just on the first few principal component variables and then say they're done. The last principle component variable, and the last few, can be very, very interesting as well, because these are the variables of the original scales, the linear combinations which have the least variability.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro07evEWbCE#t=4927.35s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	We were-- things that were coming to us on the trading desk that required subtle understanding of the underlying theory. So that we, in essence, we built theoretical framework to solve the problems that were given to us by the financial markets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=535.05s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	Every different finance book uses different notation, so just C for call price, with strike K, at little t with maturity big T. OK, just that notation. The zero-coupon bond-- the price at little t-- let's call that Z. That's the price of little t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=918.35s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	So that's the payout. This is called call spread-- just the spread between two calls, and has this payout function. OK, so a natural thing to do here, it being a mathematics class, let's take limits.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=1158.23s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	It's the expectation of a future payout. So by FTAP, the price at t is expected payout at time capital T, suitably discounted. So there's both something very straightforward here, and something very deep.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=1388.29s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	I'll buy that butterfly. So there is actually an active market in butterflies, and so I think an active trading in probabilities-- probabilities of the underlying variable being at K at maturity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=2319.03s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	That's the conclusion. So anyway, here's the story. So back in the 19th century, the Cambridge Mathematics degree-- the undergraduate Mathematics degree-- was the most prestigious degree in the world. In fact, it was actually the first undergraduate degree with a written examination was Cambridge Mathematics.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=2560.27s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	And the people who got first-class degrees-- so summa degrees-- in Cambridge Mathematics were called wranglers, and still are called wranglers, actually. And the reason they're called wranglers was from way back in the 17th century where, before they had exams-- or 18th century, I should say, before they had exams-- instead of writing down exam, you have to argue, or dispute, or wrangle with your professor to get to pass the class.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=2596.207s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	So that's where wrangler comes from. So these people who got the first-class degree are called wranglers, and they're ranked. And basically, the senior wrangler was a very famous person in the UK in the 19th century.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=2618.02s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	So If you like, the way I go from density to probability distribution to option price is exactly the Fundamental Theorem. The route I take is the Fundamental Theorem. OK, so FTAP, the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing, means I can going from the probability density to the price of a derivative, for any derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=3243.35s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	So calls span-- call prices span all derivative prices. And they are a particular type of derivative-- the ones that are determined exactly by their payout at maturity. One can imagine other things that are a function of the path or whatever.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=3350.62s
20. Option Price and Probability Duality	Of course, if I know all the digitals, I know the cumulative distribution function, and therefore, I know the density. So I mean, the digitals do the same. And in fact, Arrow-Debreu securities, which is building blocks, which is something that pays off one in a particular state, sample state, also are building blocks.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_aRPy1KVE#t=4621.3s
8. Time Series Analysis I	And so let me just review where we were. We have a normal linear regression model. A dependent variable y is explained by a linear combination of independent variables given by a regression parameter beta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=45.07s
8. Time Series Analysis I	So this likelihood function is-- well, the challenge really in maximum estimation is really calculating and computing the likelihood function. And with normal linear regression models, it's very easy. Now, the maximum likelihood estimates are those values that maximize this function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=142.95s
8. Time Series Analysis I	So robust estimators allow you to control that by defining the function differently. Finally, there are quantile estimators, which extend the mean absolute deviation criterion. And so if we consider the h function to be basically a multiple of the deviation if the residual is positive and a different multiple, a complementary multiple if the derivation, the residual, is less than 0, then by varying tau, you end up getting quantile estimators, where what you're doing is minimizing the estimate of the tau quantile.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=889.68s
8. Time Series Analysis I	And I want you to read through that just to see how it applies to fitting various simple linear regression models. And enter full screen. This case study begins by introducing the capital asset pricing model, which basically suggests that if you look at the returns on any stocks in an efficient market, then those should depend on the return of the overall market but scaled by how risky the stock is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1020.37s
8. Time Series Analysis I	And so if you're thinking about return on the stock versus return on the index, well, what's really of interest is the excess return over a risk-free rate. And the efficient markets models, basically the excess return of a stock is related to the excess return of the market as given by a linear regression model.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1093.66s
8. Time Series Analysis I	A simple linear model is just those observations that are very far from the mean have large leverage. And so you can confirm that with your answers to the problem set. This x indicates a significantly influential point in terms of the regression parameters given by Cook's distance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1176.39s
8. Time Series Analysis I	So let's begin from basically first principles. We have a stochastic process, a discrete time stochastic process, X, which consists of random variables indexed by time. And we're thinking now discrete time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1667.63s
8. Time Series Analysis I	Constants are nice things to estimate. And parameters of models are constant. So we really want the underlying structure of the distributions to be the same. That was strict stationarity, which requires knowledge of the entire distribution of the stochastic process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1764.08s
8. Time Series Analysis I	So those translated variables have mean 0 and variance 1. Then the correlation coefficient is the covariance between those standardized random variables. So this is going to come up again and again in time series analysis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1881.04s
8. Time Series Analysis I	Now, the Wold representation theorem is a very, very powerful theorem about covariance stationary processes. It basically states that if we have a zero-mean covariance stationary time series, then it can be decomposed into two components with a very nice structure.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=1900.08s
8. Time Series Analysis I	So we'll be looking for that kind of feature in different models. Let's turn to talking about the lag operator. The lag operator is a fundamental tool in time series models. We consider the operator L that shifts a time series back by one time increment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=2440.43s
8. Time Series Analysis I	Well, if you take first differences or second differences and the resulting process is covariance stationary, then we can just incorporate that differencing into the model specification itself, and define ARIMA models, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Processes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=4324.63s
8. Time Series Analysis I	And we can express the ARMA model in state space form, which results in a form for the likelihood function, which we'll see a few lectures ahead. But then we can apply limited information maximum likelihood, where we just condition on the first observations of the data and maximize the likelihood.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBeM1FUk4Ps#t=4379.28s
14. Portfolio Theory	PETER KEMPTHORNE: Today's topic is portfolio theory. An it's really one of the most important topics in finance. We're going to go through the historical theory of portfolio optimization, beginning with Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization, where we look at portfolios in terms of their performance characteristics as determined by the mean return and the volatility returns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=22.02s
14. Portfolio Theory	Then the topic of utility theory, von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, in statistical decision theory, we are trying to make decisions under uncertainty in a rational way. And von Neumann and Morgenstern developed a expected utility hypothesis for rational decision making.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=69.95s
14. Portfolio Theory	The second asset has expected return of 20% and a volatility of 30%, sigma_2. These assets are possibly correlated. We'll let rho denote the correlation between the two. And a portfolio-- basically all the portfolios we could invest in, so long as we are limited to a unit of capital and no shorting, are given by portfolios indexed by w, basically the amount of money we invest in the second asset.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=333.82s
14. Portfolio Theory	Zero variance means that over-- that its value is a constant. AUDIENCE: Is it a good idea to do that? PETER KEMPTHORNE: Well, in terms of the markets nothing has zero-- almost nothing has zero volatility.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=1153.97s
14. Portfolio Theory	And we can also consider just maximizing a weighted average of the return and have a negative multiple on the variance and consider maximizing that expression. This turns out to be the risk aversion optimization, where we basically are penalizing portfolios w for how much variance they have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=1745.22s
14. Portfolio Theory	And the lambda factor tells us how much penalty to associate per variance unit. And these are all equivalent problems being solved by the same Lagrangian. And from these problems we can define the efficient frontier, which is the collection of all possible solutions, where we range the target return amongst values that are feasible and the volatility amongst values that are feasible as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=1785.77s
14. Portfolio Theory	Now, in the Markowitz mean-variance analysis we sort of reduced all portfolios to the properties of what's their expected return and what's their variance or volatility of the returns. Under what circumstances would that be a really good decision to be making for how to do portfolio optimization, portfolio allocations? Well, the von Neumann-Morgenstern theory is a theory which motivates making decisions under uncertainty, where you should specify a utility function for your wealth, and you should engage in decisions that maximize the expected utility of your wealth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=2963.13s
14. Portfolio Theory	And there is some interesting work there in the economics literature. One thing that is to be pointed out is that with quadratic utility, then if we consider the expected utility under quadratic utility, that is the expected utility function that only depends on expected wealth and the variance of the wealth, which depends only on the expected return and the variance of the return of the portfolio.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=3305.48s
14. Portfolio Theory	The ones that are considered here are basically spider-traded funds, which invest in the different major industrial sectors of the US market, ranging from materials, health care, consumer staples, down to technology and utilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=3933.615s
14. Portfolio Theory	And we actually are de-allocating some from the consumer staples and consumer discretionary at that point. OK, here's a graph of the efficient frontier as estimated with the data. And what you can see is that these portfolios, optimal portfolios, yield improvements over each of the individual exchange-traded funds, in terms of having higher return with lower risk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=4261.84s
14. Portfolio Theory	But it doesn't characterize sort of what the potential exposure is if you exceed that. And there are extensions of that. The conditional value at risk which is looking at the expected loss given that you exceed the value at risk threshold.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywl3pq6yc54#t=4999.4s
11. Time Series Analysis II	PROFESSOR: All right. I want to complete the discussion on volatility modeling in the first part of the lecture today. And last time we addressed the definition of ARCH models, which allow for time-varying volatility in modeling the returns of a financial time series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=21.546s
11. Time Series Analysis II	ARCH orders 1, 2, and 10, thinking we maybe need many lags to fit volatility. And then the GARCH model 1,1, where we only have one ARCH term and one GARCH term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=145.89s
11. Time Series Analysis II	So let me expand this. OK. So there's the specification. The GARCH(1,1) model. One thing to note is that this GARCH(1,1) model does relate to an ARMA, an autoregressive moving average process in the squared residuals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=263.98s
11. Time Series Analysis II	We basically want to determine the likelihood function of our data given the unknown parameters. And the likelihood function is the probability density function of the data conditional on the parameters. So our likelihood function as a function of the unknown parameters c, alpha, and beta is the value of the probability density, the joint density of all the data conditional on those parameters.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=548.84s
11. Time Series Analysis II	Those should be uncorrelated with themselves or at least to the extent that they can be. And the squared standardized residuals should also be uncorrelated. What we're trying to do with these models is to capture the dependence, actually, in the squared residuals, which is measuring the magnitude of the excess returns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=748.88s
11. Time Series Analysis II	And you can see that the density functions are very, very close. The standard-- the CDFs, the cumulative distribution functions, which is the likelihood of being less than or equal to the horizontal value, ranges between 0 and 1, is almost indistinguishable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=1222.35s
11. Time Series Analysis II	All right. OK, with these GARCH models we actually are able to model volatility clustering. And volatility clustering is where, over time, you expect volatility to be high during some periods and to be low during other periods.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=1445.25s
11. Time Series Analysis II	So we need to talk about the first order moment of the multivariate time series. Mu now is an m vector, which is the vector of expected values of the individual components, which we can denote by mu_1 through mu_m.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=1931.39s
11. Time Series Analysis II	Now what's a correlation? Correlation is the correlation between two random variables where we've standardized the variables to have mean 0 and variance 1. So what we want to do is basically divide through all of these variables by their standard deviation and compute the covariance matrix on that new scaling.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=2072.969s
11. Time Series Analysis II	And so Granger causality basically is sort of positive or non-zero correlation between variables where lags of one variable will cause another or cause changes in another. All right. I want to just alert you to the existence of this Wold decomposition theorem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=2362.47s
11. Time Series Analysis II	This is an advanced theorem, but it's a useful theorem to know exists. And this extends the univariate Wold decomposition theorem, which concerns the-- whenever we have a covariant stationary process, there exists a representation of that process, which is the sum of a deterministic process and a moving average process of a white noise.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=2387.75s
11. Time Series Analysis II	And then there's some disturbance about that model. There's something new that's happened at time t that wasn't available before. And that's this innovation process. So this representation with the Wold decomposition is converting the-- or representing, basically, the bits of information that are affecting the process that are occurring at time t and wasn't available prior to that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=2694.2s
11. Time Series Analysis II	And that component time series-- like a fixed exchange rate series or time series, whatever we're focused on in our modeling-- is a generalization of the autoregressive model where we have the autoregressive terms of the j-th series on lags of the j-th series up to order p.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=2837.3s
11. Time Series Analysis II	And actually, the framework within which they specified these models was a Bayesian framework, which is an extension of the maximum likelihood method where you'll incorporate reasonable sort of prior assumptions about what the parameters ought to be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFUfFuyQlU#t=4741.59s
6. Regression Analysis	And a linear model is basically attempting to model the conditional distribution of the response variable y_i given the independent variables x_i. And the conditional distribution of the response variable is modeled simply as a linear function of the independent variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=300.6s
6. Regression Analysis	And so it may be that these residuals are like that. Anyway, a slightly simpler or weaker condition is to use the Gauss-- what are called in statistics the Gauss-Markov assumptions. And these are assumptions where we're only concerned with the means or averages, statistically, and the variances of the residuals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=893.9s
6. Regression Analysis	So the generalized Gauss-Markov theorem assumes a general covariance matrix where you can have nonzero covariances between the independent variables or the dependent variables and the residuals. And those can be correlated.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=1238.47s
6. Regression Analysis	And certainly issues of-- well, robust methods is where you assume most of the data arrives under normal conditions, but once in a while there may be some problem with the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=1454.58s
6. Regression Analysis	And you don't want your methodology just to break down if there happens to be some outliers in the data or contamination. Bayes methodologies are the technology for incorporating subjective beliefs into statistical models.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=1471.71s
6. Regression Analysis	In case analyses for checking assumptions, let me go through this. Basically when you fit a regression model, you check assumptions by looking at the residuals, which are the basically estimates of the epsilons, the deviations of the dependent variable from their predictions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=1550.96s
6. Regression Analysis	Ah. OK, the least squares criterion is for a given a regression parameter, beta, which is considered to be a column vector-- so I'm taking the transpose of a row vector. The least squares criterion is to basically take the sum of square deviations from the actual value of the response variable from its linear prediction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=1754.59s
6. Regression Analysis	So in order to solve for this, we're going to use matrices. And so we're going to take the y vector, the vector of n values of the dependent variable, or the response variable, and X, the matrix of values of the independent variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=1805.49s
6. Regression Analysis	So we're not doing a projection onto a null space. This is just a statement that those values, or those column vectors, are orthogonal to each other. And just to recap, the epsilon is a projection of y onto the space orthogonal to the column space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=2699.66s
6. Regression Analysis	OK? All right. So the Gauss-Markov theorem, we have data y and X again. And now we're going to think of the observed data, little y_1 through y_n, is actually an observation of the random vector capital Y, composed of random variables Y_1 up to Y_n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=2753.08s
6. Regression Analysis	And the covariance matrix of Y given X and beta is sigma squared times the identity matrix, the n-dimensional identity matrix. So the identity matrix has 1's along the diagonal, n-dimensional, and 0's off the diagonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=2804.75s
6. Regression Analysis	Now, the Gauss-Markov theorem says that, if the Gauss-Markov assumptions apply, then the estimator theta has the smallest variance amongst all linear unbiased estimators of theta. So it actually is like the optimal one, as long as this is our criteria.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=3068.83s
6. Regression Analysis	And what we had to do was basically do a linear transformation that makes the response variables all have constant variance and be uncorrelated. So with that, we then have the least squares estimate of beta is the least squares, the ordinary least squares, in terms of Y star and X star.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=3420.88s
6. Regression Analysis	We want to define the likelihood function, which is the density function for the data given the unknown parameters. And this density function is simply the density function for a multivariate normal random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=4802.0s
6. Regression Analysis	And the maximum likelihood estimates are the estimates of the underlying parameters that basically maximize the density function. So it's the values of the underlying parameters that make the data that was observed the most likely.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kLCrxL9Hk#t=4820.31s
17. Stochastic Processes II	The space is the space of all functions. That means it's a space of all possible paths, if you want to think about it this way. Just think about all possible ways your variable can evolve over time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPl-7_RL0Ko#t=714.81s
17. Stochastic Processes II	A function of an underlying stock, that's called financial derivatives. And then in the mathematical world, it's just a function applied to the underlying financial asset. And then, of course, what you want to do is understand the difference of the value, in terms of the difference of the underlying asset.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPl-7_RL0Ko#t=3974.135s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	And we will see how that problem can be solved. During the lecture, if you have any questions, please interrupt, OK? So what is bond? Bond is a security which is issued if someone like a borrower needs money.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=125.69s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	And again, during the beginning, the investor is asked to pay some up front. There are also zero-coupon bonds, which don't pay anything until the maturity. And there are very interesting perpetual bonds where basically you pay some money up front, and then you pay it back like infinitely-- which sounds like a good deal, but we will know how to price it right.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=178.54s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	So let's now talk about interest rate swaps. So bond cash flow is basically a stream of fixed cash flow, which means that for certain dates it's just guaranteed that you will be getting $100 with certain periodicity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=1022.17s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	A swap means you exchange fixed payments with respect to some floating. And floating means that the amount of money that you'll be getting or paying, OK, receiving or paying, will depend on some market observable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=1042.8s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	So all universe of the curves with those node points, with two continuous derivatives, can be represented as a linear combination of those basis functions. So B-spline, I mean, if you're interested, you should probably, we're not going to discuss it in details, but it's nice separate kind of topic about how to build those B-splines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=1647.02s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	OK. So now we, yeah, so the calibrate means that we basically have some solver to make sure that our swaps with the rates for those maturities actually repriced at par. At par means that the PV is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=1730.53s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	So three-month forward rate is the LIBOR rate. LIBOR is the rate for the three month. It's mostly kind of common. And the reason why is because the standard interest rate, USD swap has a three-month frequency for payment on the floating leg.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=1827.36s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	If we kind of try to put some additional constraints or additional thoughts about what this behavior should be, this may improve situation. So PCA interpretation is that risk matrix is a linear combination of principal components producing a shift on one hedging instrument at a time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=3004.83s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	But again, the result looks better, but still is not good enough. And just to demonstrate that this is an ill-posed problem-- an ill-posed problem is something that small changes of your inputs results in insane changes in your output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=3918.18s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	"So this is described on this slide. So ""ill-posed"" is that small noise may be significantly amplified by small singular values. And if you have a problem when you don't know how good it is, and whether you can trust it or not, so it's a very standard approach, you compute the condition number, which is the ratio of the maximum to minimum singular values."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=4372.86s
10. Regularized Pricing and Risk Models	But it's never the case right? So there's always uncertainty to the numbers that you're calibrating to. And your model is not always perfect. So very standard technique for that particular problem is the Tikhonov regularization, which, when you solve your ill-posed problem, as trying to minimize x minus y, you add some penalty to the amplitude to your solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aga-Tak3c3M#t=4459.35s
18. Itō Calculus	Ito integral is the limit of Riemannian sums when always take the leftmost point of each interval. So you chop down this curve at-- the time interval into pieces, and for each rectangle, pick the leftmost point, and use it as a rectangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5yRMMVUC5w#t=2207.49s
18. Itō Calculus	And then P tilde is a probability distribution defined by Brownian motion without drift. Then P and P tilde are equivalent. Not only are they equivalent, we can actually compute their Radon-Nikodym derivative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5yRMMVUC5w#t=4450.79s
23. Quanto Credit Hedging	People have made a ton of money applying quantitative concepts to that. But that's not what we're going to talk about today. What we're going to talk about is another very big area called pricing, which is pricing and hedging of complex instruments.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55OXxe_ix2o#t=116.62s
23. Quanto Credit Hedging	It's very well described in normal circumstances as random walk. So one very fundamental property that connects FX and interest rates is the so-called FX forwards interest rate parity, which says if I have a certain amount of money-- in this example, $5 million, and I can invest it, there's two ways I can utilize this money.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55OXxe_ix2o#t=356.74s
23. Quanto Credit Hedging	And this is essentially used to price FX forward contracts. So FX forward contracts are a contract that allow you to say, look, I'm going to agree with you, then in one month's time, I'm going to, say, give you 4,108,405 euros, and you're going to give me back $5,170,000.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55OXxe_ix2o#t=410.72s
23. Quanto Credit Hedging	Now, these bonds they cross-default, meaning if Italy defaults on one bond, all of its bonds default together, including the euros and the dollar bonds. So then there is a notion of credit spread, which is the measure of how risky Italy is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55OXxe_ix2o#t=1282.33s
23. Quanto Credit Hedging	I'm very familiar with them. Bonds are nothing more than loans. So zero-coupon bond means I give you some amount of money, and at some pre-agreed maturity, you're going to pay me 100.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55OXxe_ix2o#t=1660.24s
23. Quanto Credit Hedging	OK, so the dollar bonds-- dollar bond that was one bond, minus 1 bond, and the price. So the value of the dollar bond is just minus e to the minus h T minus delta T. What about the Euro bonds? Well, the Euro bonds-- here is the number of bonds we have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55OXxe_ix2o#t=3891.29s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	There are stock exchanges, futures exchanges all over the world where these products will be listed as securities on these exchanges. That's one way of trading, which is centralized. Obviously, in the last 10, 15 years, now we have ECNs, electronic platforms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=737.5s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Trade over-- you know, even larger volume of those trades. So, financial products is really just one form of trading. There are many other ways of trading aside from exchanges. One of them, which is called OTC, is over-the-counter, meaning two counterparties agree to do a trade without really subject to the exchange rules, or the underlying trading agreement does not have to be a securitized product, or standardized, or whatever ways you define it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=757.01s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	So, when we talk about trading stocks-- there are also people trade baskets of stocks, trade groups of stocks together, and that's stock index or indices. So, there are different products. How the stock get listed on the stock exchange? It goes through IPO-- Initial Public Offering process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=832.51s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	So, when a company changes from private to public, it goes through this IPO process. It's called primary market, primary listing. And once the stock is listed on the exchange and it becomes traded in the market, we call it secondary trading.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=853.21s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Loan is really a private agreement between two counterparties or multiple counterparties. When you securitize them, they become bonds. And when you look at bonds, every government will issue large sovereign debt.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=907.22s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	So asset-backed securities is when you have an asset, you basically issue a debt with the asset backing it. And how do you rate the asset's risk level and what's the income stream, cash flow? And before 2008 financial crisis, as you heard, large amount of CMBS-- basically, it's a commercial real estate backed securities, mortgage securities, and the residential, as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=1016.0s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Essentially, after 1933 Glass-Steagall legislation, there were two main types of banks. One is called commercial bank, the other is investment bank. Commercial bank is supposedly, you're taking deposits and lend out the money, and doing more commercial services.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=1109.0s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Fixed income, which trade the debt and the derivative products. Equity, trade stocks and the derivative products. And IBD, stands for Investment Banking Division, which really covers corporate finance, raising capital, listing a stock, IPO, and merger and acquisition, and advisory.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=1183.59s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Mutual funds, who actually manage public investors' money, typically in the long-only format. Long means you buy something. So, you don't really short sell a particular security. Insurance companies has large asset.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=1432.63s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	They need to generate a return, generate cash flow to meet their liability needs. So, they need to invest. And the pension funds, same thing. As inflation goes higher, they need to pay out more to the retirees, so where do you get the return? Sovereign wealth fund, similarly, endowment funds-- they all have this same situation, have capital and needs to deploy and to make better return.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=1452.13s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	And the private equity is different type of funds. They basically look to invest in companies and either take them private or invest in a private equity form to hopefully improve the company's profitability, and then catch up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=1513.2s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Delta, which describes the [INAUDIBLE] relationship of this whole book to the underlying stock, or underlying whatever currency. That's called delta. Gamma is really the change of the portfolio. Take the derivative to the delta, or to the underlying spot.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=2093.929s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	Or momentum, same thing. Stat arb, finding statistical relationship among large number of stocks, then trade at the higher frequency. And fundamental analysis, you're really trying to understand what's going on in the world.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=2371.75s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	The robotrader, a robotic trader, is a dream. It has its place or its use, but it's a fast evolving market. You have to constantly either upgrade your research and adjust your strategies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=2593.56s
1. Introduction, Financial Terms and Concepts	And one project is [INAUDIBLE] worked was on estimating the noisy derivative. Derivative is called delta. Delta is usually the first derivative to a function. And as we will see in the class, quite often, to obtain a price, you do it through Monte Carlo, meaning running a lot of paths and then averaging along them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo#t=3322.15s
5. Stochastic Processes I	So a stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time, a very simple definition. So we have either-- let's start from 0-- random variables like this, or we have random variables given like this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=33.92s
5. Stochastic Processes I	And you know all the values in the past-- know. And in the future, you don't know. But you want to know something about it. You want to have some intelligent conclusion, intelligent information about the future, based on the past.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=404.66s
5. Stochastic Processes I	Then define, for each time t, X sub t as the sum of Y_i, from i equals 1 to t. Then the sequence of random variables-- and X_0 is equal to 0-- X0, X1, X2, and so on is called a one-dimensional simple random walk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=745.99s
5. Stochastic Processes I	So now denote the probability i, j as the probability that, if at that time t you are at i, the probability that you jump to j at time t plus 1 for all pair of points i, j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=2344.38s
5. Stochastic Processes I	So it's A square. Why is it? So let me write this down in a different way. q_(i,j) is, you sum over all intermediate values the probability that you jump from i to k, first, and then the probability that you jump from k to j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=2556.81s
5. Stochastic Processes I	So before stating the theorem, I have to define what a stopping point means. So given a stochastic process, a non-negative integer valued random variable tau is called a stopping time, if, for all integer k greater than or equal to 0, tau, lesser or equal to k, depends only on X_1 to X_k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=4073.995s
5. Stochastic Processes I	In other words, if this is some strategy you want to use-- by strategy I mean some strategy that you stop playing at some point. You have a strategy that is defined as you play some k rounds, and then you look at the outcome.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuTmC8aOQJE#t=4183.34s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	But there are more complicated derivatives, underlying for which could be interest rates, bonds, swaps, commodities, whatever. So a derivative contract is some-- in general speaking, a formal pay-out connected to underlying.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=246.16s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	Usually, the underlying is a liquid instrument which is traded on exchanges. And derivative may be traded on exchanges. Actually, quite a few equity options are traded on exchanges. But in general, they are over-the-counter contracts where two counterparties just agree on some kind of pay-out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=267.81s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	One of the simpler derivatives is a forward contract. So what is a forward contract? A forward contract is a contract where one party agrees to buy an asset from another party for a price which is agreed today.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=288.42s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	So if previously the forward is an obligation to buy the asset for an agreed price, call option is actually an option to buy an asset at the agreed price today. You can view it-- a call option can be viewed as kind of insurance that the-- against the asset going down.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=393.2s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	Another simple contract, which is kind of dual to call option, is a put option. So put option, on the contrary, is a bet on the asset going down, rather than up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=526.69s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	Right? So somehow there is no uncertainty. It's completely deterministic, once we know the price of underlying. The other interesting fact, which we'll find out, is actually risk-neutrality, meaning that in fact, the price of the option has nothing to do with the risk preferences of market participants or counter-parties.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=612.14s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	And riskless meaning that it grows exponentially with some interest rate r. And there is no uncertainty. It's completely-- if you have now B_0, we know then, in time dt, our B_0 will grow exponentially.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=700.0s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	But such probability exists. And it's called-- the measure where our stock behaves like this is called a risk-neutral measure or martingale measure. And in this measure, as we will see, the value of the derivative will be just expected value of our pay-out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=1323.96s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	And let's make an assumption that it is log-normal. What does it mean that it's log-normal? It means that the proportional change of the stock, over infinitely small amount of time dt, has some drift mu, and some stochastic component, which is just Brownian Motion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=1366.93s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	But not in real time or real-world measure, but in some specific risk-neutral measure. And how do we find this risk-neutral measure? Well, the risk-neutral measure is such that the drift of our stock is actually interest rate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=2050.429s
19. Black-Scholes Formula, Risk-neutral Valuation	The assumption of Black-Scholes is that every option, for any strike, on a given stock, on a given expiry, would have the same volatility. Right? So if we went through exercise of implying the volatility according to Black-Scholes formula, from the option price which is traded on the market and the current price, we would find out that, actually, the volatility is not constant with strike.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS8kI_KuJc#t=2306.84s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	So the word risk-neutral is meant to indicate that the growth rate under this measure is consistent with investors in the economy being risk-neutral, meaning that they require no premium for bearing risk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=571.05s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	And these are three different phrases that all describe the same mathematical object. And this mathematical object is a portfolio-- and more precisely, it's the value of a portfolio that has some nice properties.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=1160.59s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	So there's only one source of uncertainty, which is the same as in Ross. And our technique is to get these results. It's based on something called change of numeraire. So numeraire is a technical term, actually, that describes an asset whose value is always positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=1527.02s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	So there are securities whose values can have either sign. So, swaps are a classical example. So a swap is a security which at inception has zero value, actually. And then the moment after inception, the world changes, and the swap value either becomes positive or becomes negative.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=1547.16s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	Then there'll be the desired output from this analysis, which he calls natural probability transition matrix. So these are the markets beliefs for every starting value x and for every final value y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=2948.5s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	And then there'll be something called pricing kernel, which is literally the ratio of these Arrow-Debreu security prices to these output natural probabilities. So, if you want to get an understanding of what this pricing kernel is, you can think of it as an attempt to capture the effects from time value of money and from risk aversion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=2962.18s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	And I've been calling that R often. So anyway, I slipped a bit there and called it P. So anyway, that's market beliefs about the frequencies of future states. He'll also get as an output the delta, which is the positive scalar telling you the market's time value of money.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=3362.75s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	And so now, we'll get into some theory about changing numeraire. So this is a backdrop to how my co-author and I proceed. So again, a numeraire is a portfolio whose value is always strictly positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=3761.22s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	So b^Q(x, t) was the drift coefficient of x. And now it's a function of x only. r(x, t) was the function linking the short interest rate to the state variable x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=4704.33s
25. Ross Recovery Theorem	As you pay money now, you're going to receive that payoff. It's the opposite of short, where if you're short a security with a non-negative payoff, then actually you get money now and you have to deliver that payoff later.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5dotshPZc#t=4893.604s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And in order for the process to be invertible, basically, the roots of the characteristic polynomial need to be less than 1 in magnitude. In this implementation of the vector autoregression model, the characteristic roots are the inverses of the characteristic roots that we've been discussing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=89.72s
12. Time Series Analysis III	The partial autocorrelation coefficients are the correlation between one variable and the lag of another after explaining for all lower degree lags. So it's like the incremental correlation of a variable with a lag term that exists.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=288.6s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And so if we are actually fitting regression models where we include extra lags of a given variable, that partial autocorrelation coefficient is essentially the correlation associated with the addition of the final lagged variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=310.76s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And in the previous discussion, we addressed non-stationarity of series by taking first differences to eliminate that non-stationarity. But we may be losing some information with that differencing. And cointegration provides a framework within which we characterize all available information for statistical modeling, in a very systematic way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=683.98s
12. Time Series Analysis III	So let's introduce the context within which cointegration is relevant. It's relevant when we have a stochastic process, a multivariate stochastic process, which is integrated of some order d. And to be integrated of order d means that if we take the d-th difference, then that d-th difference is stationary.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=712.92s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And so cointegration deals with this situation where some linear combinations of the multivariate series in fact are stationary. So how do we represent that mathematically? Well, we say that this multivariate time series process is cointegrated if there exists an m-vector beta such that, defining linear weights on the x's, and beta prime X_t is a stationary process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=952.23s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And so if there are disparities in currency values, purchase power parity suggests that things will revert back to some norm where everybody is paying on average over time the same amount for different goods.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=1100.72s
12. Time Series Analysis III	Now, these cointegrating relationships are the relationships in the process that are stationary. And so basically there's a lot of information in that multivariate series with contemporaneous values of the series. There is stationary structure at every single time point, which can be the target of the modeling.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=2020.55s
12. Time Series Analysis III	So that simplifies that. The moving average model of order q could also be expressed as a linear state-space model. Remember, the moving average model is one where our response variable, y, is simply some linear combination of innovations, q past innovations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=3556.54s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And this state vector, if we consider the state vector just being basically q lags of the innovations, then the transition of those underlying states is given by this expression here. And we have a state equation, an observation equation, which has these forms for these various transition matrices and for how the innovation terms are related.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=3590.5s
12. Time Series Analysis III	s sub t given t is the mean value of the state at time t given the information up to time t. If we condition on t minus 1, then it's the expectation of the state at time t given the information up to t minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=4132.09s
12. Time Series Analysis III	That's the definition of that covariance matrix. So the different definitions here correspond to just whether we're conditioning on different information. And then the observation innovations or residuals are the difference between an observation y_t and its estimate given information up to t minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=4207.95s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And then finally, there's a smoothing step which is characterizing the conditional expectation of underlying states, given information in the whole time series. And so ordinarily with Kalman filters, Kalman filters are applied sequentially over time where one basically is predicting ahead one step, updating that prediction, predicting ahead another step, updating the information on the states.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=4469.52s
12. Time Series Analysis III	And so the likelihood function for the linear state-space model is basically the-- or the log-likelihood is the log-likelihood of the entire data series, give the unknown parameters. But that can be expressed as the product of the conditional distributions of each successive observation, given the history.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1IDAqrWkg#t=4543.43s
4. Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions	YUFEI ZHAO: Last time, we started discussing the extremal problem for bipartide graphs. And in particular, we saw the Kovari-Sos-Turan theorem, which tells us that if you forbid your graph from having a complete bipartide graph, Kst, then you have this upper bound on the number of edges in your graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LYom0ekars#t=18.955s
4. Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions	And the base field is the field where it is invariant under power by p. So here's the graph, which I'll denote the norm graph with parameters p and s. So the norm graph will have as vertices just the elements of this field extension.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LYom0ekars#t=360.42s
4. Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions	In particular, we're not going to use that theorem up there, but we'll use some other algebraic geometry fact. OK, so let's take a quick break. So what I want to discuss now is a relatively new idea called a randomized algebraic construction, which combines some ideas from both the randomized construction and also the algebraic construction that we just saw.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LYom0ekars#t=1988.25s
4. Forbidding a subgraph III: algebraic constructions	But that's not too hard to handle. So let me write M sub r to be the number of subjective functions from d element set to an r elements set, an M to be sum of these M sub r's for r up to d.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LYom0ekars#t=3694.22s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	So by definition, a Ramanujan graph is a d-regular graph, such that, if you look at its eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, as above, the second largest eigenvalue in absolute value is, at most, that bound up there-- 2 root d minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=181.81s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	If the first eigenvector has eigenvalue lambda, then the second one has eigenvalue minus lambda. So the eigenvalues come in symmetric pairs. So by definition, a bipartite Ramanujan graph is one where it's a bipartite graph and I only require that the second largest eigenvalue is less than 2 root d minus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=666.68s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	That's not affected by the density scale. Previously, we had the irregularity lemma, which said that for every epsilon, there exists some M such that every graph has an epsilon regular partition into at most M parts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=2107.2s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	And an example of such an hypothesis is something called no dense spots, meaning that it doesn't have a really dense component, like in the case of a click on a very small number of vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=2417.57s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	And then I'll add in the extra relative things in yellow. So if I start with A, the subset of z mod N, such that A has size-- at least delta n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=3949.92s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	And then there's a super saturation argument, which is similar to things you've done in the homework. What we would like is a relative version. And a relative version will say that if you have a set, S, which is sufficiently pseudo-random.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=4024.275s
13. Sparse regularity and the Green-Tao theorem	So there is an additional method-- which, unfortunately I don't have time to discuss-- called transference, where the story I've told you is that you look at the proof of Roth's theorem, the proof of Szemeredi's theorem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPjyNsEHQM#t=4630.96s
14. Graph limits I: introduction	You look at their adjacency matrix. You view it as a picture, a pixelated image, black and white according to the zeros and ones in its adjacency matrix. And as you take a sequence, you make your eyes a little bit blurry.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3tGiT72APw#t=800.71s
14. Graph limits I: introduction	The range is 0, 1. So here are some quantities we are interested in when considering graph limits. So given two graphs, G and H, we say that a graph homomorphism-- so a graph homomorphism between from G to H is a map of their vertexes such that the edges are preserved.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3tGiT72APw#t=1178.19s
14. Graph limits I: introduction	So it's the number of proper three colorings, the number of proper colorings of H with three labeled colors, red, green, and blue. So think about the three vertices. That's red, green, and blue.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3tGiT72APw#t=1373.82s
14. Graph limits I: introduction	So in terms of graph limits when n gets large, I don't need to distinguish so much between homomorphisms and subgraphs. We define the homomorphism density, denoted by the letter t, from H to G, by-- define it to be the fraction of all vertex maps that are homomorphisms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3tGiT72APw#t=1473.69s
14. Graph limits I: introduction	So we have seen this before when we discussed removal lemmas. The edit distance is the number of edges you need to change to go from one graph to the other graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3tGiT72APw#t=2338.69s
5. Forbidding a subgraph IV: dependent random choice	So the graph is G. And what we are going to do is look at the set A, which is the set of common neighbors of T, the vertices that are adjacent to all of T. And that's the set I want to think about.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMv0Nqmy3c#t=635.21s
5. Forbidding a subgraph IV: dependent random choice	So it's not an edge, but I talk about these pairs. I say that it is light if the number of common neighbors between-- of u and v is at least 1 and less than t choose 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMv0Nqmy3c#t=3756.94s
3. Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph	And just to understand, the extremal number for this graph is a famous open problem in this area, and it has the name of Zarankiewicz problem, which is to determine or estimate the extremal numbers for these complete bipartite graphs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDwkKrWqdZE#t=222.47s
3. Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph	It's also a very short, very neat proof. I want to tell you about another problem which looks superficially similar and also a really interesting geometric problem. And this is the Erdos distinct distances problem, which asks for the maximum number of distinct distances among n points in the plane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDwkKrWqdZE#t=1775.99s
3. Forbidding a subgraph II: complete bipartite subgraph	And I want to introduce you to some of these techniques. And the first one comes from the probabilistic method, where we use a randomized construction by picking a graph at random, modifying it a little bit in a way that's to our desire.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDwkKrWqdZE#t=2121.7s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	So we say x and y is epsilon regular if for all subsets A of X, all B subsets of Y that are not too small, so each at least an epsilon proportion of the sets that they live in, we find that the x density between A and B differs from the x density between X and X by no more than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=382.71s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	"So when I say ""to exhibit"" or ""to witness irregularity,"" that's what I mean. Now, there's a bit of an unfortunate nomenclature in graph theory, where previously, we said ""irregular graphs"" to mean that every vertex is degree D."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=606.15s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	So an epsilon regular partition, we say that a partition-- and generally, I will denote partition by curly letters such as that, P. So the partition will divide a vertex set into a bunch of subsets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=653.94s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	So now we're ready to state Szemeredi's regularity lemma. And it says that for every epsilon, there exists some constant M depending only on epsilon such that every graph has an epsilon regular partition into at most M parts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=919.96s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	"So pseudo-random graph, in some sense, means graphs that are not random, but behave in some sense like random. So ""random-like"" generally just means that in some aspect, in some property, it looks like a random object."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=1209.39s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	"And ""equitable partition"" sometimes is also called an ""equipartition,"" meaning that it has such that all the Ai's, all the Bi's have sizes differing by at most 1. So basically, all the parts have the same size up to at most 1, because of divisibility."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=1316.06s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	"And to do this, we will define some notion called an ""energy"" of a partition. And this energy will increase. So first of all, the energy is some quantity that we'll define that lies between 0 and 1."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=1780.75s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	It is a mean squared density, some weighted mean of the edge densities between pairs of parts in the partition. You might ask, why is it called an energy? So you might see from this formula here, it's some kind of a mean square density, so it's some kind of an average of squares.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=2153.3s
6. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma I: statement and proof	"Sometimes, you can just do that by refining, but maybe if you have some really small parts, then you might need to move some vertices around, so I call that ""rebalancing."" So move and merge some vertices, but only a very small number of vertices, to make equitable."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsxCFSLyP8#t=4520.5s
2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem	So remember, independent set is a subset of vertices with no edges inside. It may have many independent sets all having the same maximum size. Take one of them. So why should you do this step? Well, you know, sometimes magic happens.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1sd4kuOQ#t=481.426s
2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem	So that graph, the complete bipartite graph with two equal parts, is the unique maximal example, number of edges in a triangle-free graph. Great. So once we know what the answer is for triangle-free, of course, we should ask further questions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1sd4kuOQ#t=749.08s
2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem	It's Turán's theorem. So a Turán graph, so we'll denote T sub nr. It is a complete r-partite graph such that there are n vertices whose part sizes are all nearly the same, up to at most 1 difference.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1sd4kuOQ#t=880.735s
2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem	So subgraph only requires you to have a subset of vertices and a subset of edges, whereas induced subgraphs-- this is not an example of induced subgraph. And so induced subgraph means that you take this set of vertices and you look at all the edges in the big graph among your set of vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1sd4kuOQ#t=3237.96s
2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem	So if you call me the chromatic number of H, I can already tell you quite a lot. So just to remind you, the chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors you need to properly color this graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1sd4kuOQ#t=3399.64s
2. Forbidding a subgraph I: Mantel's theorem and Turán's theorem	Chromatic number of H, denoted chi of H, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of H so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. So for instance, if I give you a clique of r plus 1 vertices, so all the vertices must receive different colors, because every pair of vertices is adjacent-- so the chromatic number is r plus 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1sd4kuOQ#t=3414.39s
10. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma V: hypergraph removal and spectral proof	And we used the triangle removal lemma to deduce Roth's theorem. Remember, there was a graph theoretic set up where start with a 3-AP-free subset. We set up a graph, and then that graph has some nice properties that allows us to use a corollary of the triangle removal lemma, namely the corollary that says that if you have a graph, where every edge sits on exactly one triangle, then it has a sub quadratic number of edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUFitIoE14#t=271.3s
10. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma V: hypergraph removal and spectral proof	You read the proof and everything works exactly the same way, once you have the removal lemma. By tetrahedron, I mean the complete graph on four vertices. Complete three graph of four vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUFitIoE14#t=547.305s
10. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma V: hypergraph removal and spectral proof	So let's build first a graph, so a random two graph which I'll call g2. So this is just the Erdos-Renyi random graph, gnp. The usual one where you flip a coin for each edge so that each edge appears with probability p independently.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUFitIoE14#t=1763.63s
10. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma V: hypergraph removal and spectral proof	So linear means every pair of edges intersecting at most one vertex. So for example, if you look at-- so hypergraph or each line is an edge of triples. So that's a linear hypergraph because each pair intersecting at most one vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUFitIoE14#t=2104.64s
10. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma V: hypergraph removal and spectral proof	So the spectral radius spectral norm of a is the largest eigenvalue of a in absolute value. And this quantity turns out to be equal to the operator norm which is the norm of this a as a linear operator, namely it is the max or super, it turns out to be a max, of av over-- length of av divided by length of v.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUFitIoE14#t=4038.11s
7. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma II: triangle removal lemma	So there is some edge density. And I say they're epsilon regular if they behave random-like in the following sense-- that the edges are somehow distributed in a fairly uniform way so that if I look at some smaller subsets A and B, but not too small, then the edge densities between A and B is very similar to the ambient edge densities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD9AWDdj-Yk#t=151.1s
7. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma II: triangle removal lemma	So then it's very hard to make any useful statement. So that's why these two conditions are needed. And here, the edge density is defined to be the number of edges with one endpoint in A, one endpoint in B, divided by the product of the sizes of A and B. And we say that a partition of the vertex set of the graph is epsilon regular if, by summing over all pairs i, j, such that vi, vj is not epsilon regular if we sum up the product of these part sizes, then this sum is at most an epsilon fraction of the total number of pairs of vertices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD9AWDdj-Yk#t=189.62s
7. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma II: triangle removal lemma	So it's a rule for how to put in the edges. And this is basically a Cayley graph, a bipartite variant of a Cayley graph. Likewise, I put an edge between x and z.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD9AWDdj-Yk#t=3351.74s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	All right. So now, we're in the setting where we are looking at some space, a cyclic group, for instance. And now, we have positive proportion, a constant proportion subset of that group.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=120.85s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	And this is an important step in a proof of Freiman's theorem. And this step is known as Bogolyubov's lemma. So Bogolyubov's lemma, in the case of F2 to the n, says that if you have a subset A of F2 to the n of fraction alpha of the space, then 2A minus 2A contains a bounded codimensional subspace, so a very large subspace.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=555.74s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	We define a Bohr set, denoted like this, so Bohr of R and epsilon, to be the subset of Z mod n, so including elements x, such that rx is pretty close to a multiple of n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=1639.84s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	So you asked something earlier about-- something seems a bit fishy about the general strategy. Seems like our goal for proving-- we want to prove Freiman's theorem, which says that the conclusion is that A is contained in some GAP, some fairly compact additive structure.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=2248.46s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	And we've actually already seen a tool that allows us to do that. So I want to cover all of A. So last time, we did something called the covering lemma, Ruzsa covering lemma, that tells us that if you have some nice control on A and you can cover some part of A very well, then I can cover the entirety of A very well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=2355.516s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	So the result from the geometry of numbers that we're going to need is something called Minkowski's second theorem. So Minkowski's second theorem says that if you have lambda, a lattice, in Rd and k, a centrally symmetric body, also in Rd, such that lambda 1 through lambda d are the successive minima of k with respect to lambda, then one has the inequality lambda 1, lambda 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=3157.85s
23. Structure of set addition III: Bogolyubov's lemma and the geometry of numbers	"So ""proper"" means that in this generalized arithmetic progression, all the individual terms are distinct, or you don't have collisions. So you're going to find this proper GAP that is constant dimension and at least a constant fraction of the size of the group, so pretty large GAP."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BatYGepHsnc#t=3453.91s
18. Roth's theorem I: Fourier analytic proof over finite field	And what we'll do is to use this Fourier coefficient to extract some codimension 1 affine subspace-- it's also called a hyperplane-- where the density of A goes up significantly, if you restrict to that sub hyperplane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buEtwpGvQpI#t=936.19s
18. Roth's theorem I: Fourier analytic proof over finite field	It's because the characters, the set of characters, is an orthonormal basis. So the Fourier characters form an orthonormal basis. As a result, what the Fourier transform is is a unitary change of basis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buEtwpGvQpI#t=1490.08s
15. Graph limits II: regularity and counting	[SQUEAKING] PROFESSOR: Last time, we started discussing graph limits. And let me remind you some of the notions and definitions that were involved. One of the main objects in graph limits is that of a graphon, which are symmetric, measurable functions from the unit squared to the unit interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gy-CAwx0Ls#t=0.5s
15. Graph limits II: regularity and counting	So you can view it as a projection in the sense of Hilbert space. So in the Hilbert space of functions on the unit square, the stepping operator is a projection unto the subspace of constants, subspace of functions that are constant on each step.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gy-CAwx0Ls#t=2114.06s
15. Graph limits II: regularity and counting	In particular, the problem that is of interest is in approximating something called a max cut. So the max cut problem asks you to determine-- given a graph G, find the maximum over all subsets of vertices, the maximum number of vertices between a set and its complement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gy-CAwx0Ls#t=2662.18s
15. Graph limits II: regularity and counting	And is martingale is such a sequence where if I'm interested in the expectation of the next term and even if you know all the previous terms-- so you have full knowledge of the sequence before time n, and you want to predict on the expectation what the nth term is-- then you cannot do better than simply predicting the last term that you saw.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gy-CAwx0Ls#t=3812.01s
15. Graph limits II: regularity and counting	So it's a fair stock market where you tell me the price, and I get to decide, do I want to buy? Or do I want to sell? So consider the betting strategy where at any time, we're going to hold either 0 or 1 share of the stock, which has these moving prices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gy-CAwx0Ls#t=4581.71s
20. Roth's theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity	So, in matrix language, this is a column vector times a row vector. So that's the meaning of rank 1. And to say that something is of high rank of a specific rank-- rather, the rank of F is defined to be the minimum number of rank 1 functions needed to write F as a sum or a linear combination.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUA6lk7X2VY#t=411.13s
20. Roth's theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity	And tensors have, already, a natural notion of rank, and this is called tensor rank. Just like how, here, F is-- we say rank 1 if it's decomposable like that, we say F has tensor rank 1 if this three-variable function is decomposable as a product of one-variable functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUA6lk7X2VY#t=477.96s
20. Roth's theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity	And it turns out, this is not the right notion to use for our problem. So we're going to use a different notion of rank. Here, rank 1 is decomposing this three-variable function into a product of three one-variable functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUA6lk7X2VY#t=519.703s
20. Roth's theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity	So this is the definition of a rank one function, a slice rank 1. And, also, if nonzero. If it's nonzero and can be written in one of these forms. And, just like earlier, we define the slice rank of F to be the minimum number of slice rank 1 functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUA6lk7X2VY#t=580.2s
20. Roth's theorem III: polynomial method and arithmetic regularity	So this is the theorem. So let me say the intuition again. It says that, given an arbitrary set A, provided the space dimension is large enough, there exists some popular common difference, where popular means that the number of 3-AP's with that common difference is at least roughly as many as random.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUA6lk7X2VY#t=2958.83s
17. Graph limits IV: inequalities between subgraph densities	And the Kruskal-Katona, the combinatorial version, is proved via a combinatorial shifting argument, also known as a compression argument. Namely, if you start with a given graph, there are some transformations you do to that graph to push your edges in one direction that saves the number of edges exactly the same but increases the number of triangles at each step.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJziV7sAZm4#t=1673.41s
17. Graph limits IV: inequalities between subgraph densities	So node weighted simple graphs, by this I mean a graph where some of the edges are present and I have a node weight-- a weight for each node. And to normalize things properly, I'm going to assume that the nodes' weights add up to 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJziV7sAZm4#t=2007.15s
17. Graph limits IV: inequalities between subgraph densities	It is open. We don't know any counterexamples. And the first open example, it's known as something called a Mobius strip. So the Mobius strip graph, which is a fancy name for the graph consisting of taking a K55 and removing a 10 cycle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJziV7sAZm4#t=4481.79s
16. Graph limits III: compactness and applications	So remember we're compactness says. I start with this space W tilda, which is the space of graphons, where I identify graphons that have distance 0. So if they have cut distance 0, then I refer to them as the same point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCWwhF0TkVI#t=140.95s
16. Graph limits III: compactness and applications	And the main observation is that this is a Martingale. So remember the definition of a Martingale from last time. Martingale is one where, if you look at the value of u sub k conditioned on the previous values, the expectation is just the previous term.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCWwhF0TkVI#t=1583.8s
16. Graph limits III: compactness and applications	So we can now compute the difference between-- in fact, let's do it this way. So now let's compute the difference, the cut norm of the difference between the term in the sequence W sub n and u.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCWwhF0TkVI#t=1878.3s
21. Structure of set addition I: introduction to Freiman's theorem	So the obedient group that I'm going to keep in mind, the ones that will come up generally are integers, z mod n or the finite field model. We're going to be looking at objects such as a sum set, so a plus b, meaning the set of elements that can be written as a sum, where you take one element from a and another from b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLwZFBZylUw#t=61.15s
21. Structure of set addition I: introduction to Freiman's theorem	So a Generalized Arithmetic Progression, which we will abbreviate by the letters GAP, is a set of numbers of the form as above, except now you have d different directions and indices, are also straightforward generalizations of what was earlier.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLwZFBZylUw#t=873.2s
21. Structure of set addition I: introduction to Freiman's theorem	Let's say it's the group bipartite graph with the group elements on both sides. And the graph has edges, the bipartite graph, where the edges are from each vertex a drawn edge for each element of B. So I expand by B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLwZFBZylUw#t=2830.21s
21. Structure of set addition I: introduction to Freiman's theorem	And as earlier, we can take out contributions that were already appearing earlier, which we now recall W plus gamma, where W is the set of elements in x, such that x plus gamma is already contained in x plus C prime.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLwZFBZylUw#t=3721.49s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	So can you make A plus A and A times A simultaneously small? So there's this conjecture that the answer is no. And this is a famous conjecture in this area, known as the Erdos similarity conjecture on the sum product problem, which states that for all finite sets of real numbers, either A plus A or A times A has to be close to quadratic size.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=194.63s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	"So Erdos and Szemeredi proved some bound, which is like 1 plus c for some constant c. Today we'll show some bounds for somewhat better c's. So you'll see. The first tool that I want to introduce is a result from graph theory known as the ""crossing number inequality."" So you know that planar graphs are graphs where you can draw on the planes so that the edges do not cross."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=262.019s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	Draw the graph where edges are continuous curves. How many crossings do you get? The crossing is a pair of edges that cross. You can ask-- it's just a cross over point that can-- it doesn't matter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=385.87s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	"Incidence geometry is this area of discrete math that concerns fairly basic-sounding questions about incidences between, let's say, points and lines. And here's an example. So what's the maximum number of incidences between endpoints and end lines, where by ""incidence"" I mean if p-- so curly p-- is a set of points, and curly l is a set of lines, then I write I of p and l to be the number of pairs, one point, one line, such that the point lies on the line."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=1286.82s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	And this is a consequence of an important result in incidence geometry, a fundamental result, known as the Szemeredi-Trotter theorem. So the Szemeredi-Trotter theorem says that the number of incidences between points and lines is upper bounded by this function where you look at the number of points times the number of lines, and each raised to power 2/3 and plus some additional terms, just in case there are many more lines compared to points or way more points compared to lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=1853.77s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	So you can interpret what this quotient A is. This is the set of all A divided by B, where A and B are in A. A is a set of positive reals, so I don't need to worry about division by 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=3255.59s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	And people generally believe that that's the case. Any questions? So this concludes all the topics I want to cover in this course. So we went a long way. And so the beginning of this course, we started with extremal graph theory, looking at the basic problem of if you have a graph that doesn't contain some subgraph, triangle, C4, what's the maximum number of edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=4233.83s
26. Sum-product problem and incidence geometry	All of these proofs, all of these techniques, involve some kind of interplay between structure and pseudo-randomness. In the past month or, so we've been looking at Freiman's theorem, this key result in additive combinatorics concerning the structure of sets under addition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydyiq1Z22gc#t=4327.3s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	One of the concepts that came up when we were discussing the statement of Szemerédi's regularity lemma is that of pseudorandomness. So the statement of Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma is that you can partition an arbitrary graph into a bounded number of pieces so that the graph looks random-like, as we called it, between most pairs of parts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=31.64s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	So this notion is known as discrepancy. And it says that if I restrict my graph to looking only at edges between some pair of vertex sets, then the number of edges should be roughly what you would expect based on density alone.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=330.7s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	And the codegree condition says that if you look at a pair of vertices and look at their number of common neighbors-- in other words, their codegree-- then what should you expect this quantity to be? So there are n vertices that possibly could be common neighbors, and each one of them, if this were a random graph with edge probability p, then you expect the number of common neighbors to be around p squared n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=571.72s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	If some eigenvalue occurs with multiple times, I include it multiple times. So the eigenvalue condition says that the top eigenvalue is around pn and that, more importantly, the other eigenvalues are all quite small.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=663.94s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	So I've stated this theorem so far in this form where there is a little 1 error. But equivalently, so I can equivalently state theorem as-- for example, have DISC with an epsilon error, which is that some inequality is true with at most epsilon error instead of little o.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=789.49s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	So first, it implies a C4 condition, because up to-- so instead of counting C4s, which is a little bit actually not-- it's a bit annoying to do actual C4s. Just like earlier, we want to consider homomorphic copies, which are also labeled walks, so closed walks of length 4.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=2926.25s
11. Pseudorandom graphs I: quasirandomness	So graphs with that specific property, taking a small subset of vertices always gets you lots of neighbors, are called expander graphs. And these graphs play an important role, in particular, in computer science in designing algorithms and proving complexity results and so on but also play important roles in graph theory and combinatorics.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPcNnUrE24#t=4618.51s
19. Roth's theorem II: Fourier analytic proof in the integers	"So we want to understand, in what ways is A pseudorandom? And here, ""pseudorandom,"" just as with last time, means having small Fourier coefficients, being Fourier uniform. If A is pseudorandom, which here, means f and g are close to each other."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50oEJs-HZHQ#t=1557.68s
19. Roth's theorem II: Fourier analytic proof in the integers	If you have A that is 3AP-free with density alpha, and N is large enough, then there exists some subprogression P. So by subprogression, I just mean that I'm starting with original progression 1 through N, and I'm zooming into some subprogression, with the length of P fairly long, so the length of P is at least cube root of N, and such that A, when restricted to this subprogression, has a density increment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50oEJs-HZHQ#t=2915.98s
19. Roth's theorem II: Fourier analytic proof in the integers	So in Z mod nZ, we define-- so given a S, let's define this Bohr set to be the set of elements of Z mod nZ such that if you look at what really is supposed to resemble this thing over here, OK? If this quantity is small for all S-- OK, so we put that element into this Bohr set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50oEJs-HZHQ#t=4310.04s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	YUFEI ZHAO: The goal for the next few lecturers is to prove Freiman's theorem, which we discussed last time. And so we started with this tool that we proved called the Plunnecke-Ruzsa inequality, which tells us that if you have a set A now in an arbitrary abelian group, and if A has controlled doubling, it has bounded doubling, then all the further iterated sumsets have bounded growth, as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=18.502s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	Instead of addition, you have multiplication. So that's why it's called exponent. So the name is stuck, even though we're still working on the additive setting. We're going to write this, so the angle brackets, to mean the subgroup generated by the subset A, where A is a subset of the group elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=826.83s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	In the integers, well, that's not very good. So the strategy of Freiman's theorem, the proof of Freiman's theorem, is to start with the integers, and then try to, not work in the integers, but try to work in a smaller group.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=1655.76s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	And the notion of Freiman homomorphisms Freiman isomorphism capture what specific properties we need to study and what are the maps that preserve those properties. And the next thing we will do is to understand this model lemma, the modeling lemma, that tells us that if you start with a set A with small doubling, initially A may be very much spread out in the integers-- it may have very large elements, very small elements, very spread out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=2585.98s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	And finally, we can consider the representative map, where every element of Z mod q, I can associate to it a positive integer from 1 to q which agrees with the Z mod q.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=3366.94s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	And you can do this by pigeonhole. So by pigeonhole, for every lambda there exists some interval we'll denote by I sub lambda inside q. So the length of this interval will be at most q/s, such that if I look at the restriction of this interval, I pull it all the way back to the beginning then I still get a lot of elements of A. So A sub lambda, namely the elements of A whose map gets sent to this interval, has at least A/s elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=3458.67s
22. Structure of set addition II: groups of bounded exponent and modeling lemma	So for each d that potentially witnessed some bad lambda, the number of bad lambda, i.e., such that phi of d is congruent to 0 mod m, so here we're no longer even thinking about group homomorphisms anymore or the Freiman homomorphisms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwikpgvkN_o#t=4373.25s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	So I want to begin today with an example. A lot of examples, especially for pseudorandomness, come from this class of graphs called Cayley graphs, which are built from a group. So we're going to reserve the letter G for graphs, so I'm going to use gamma for a group.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=243.92s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	And I have a subset S of gamma, and S is symmetric, in that if you invert the elements of S, they remain in S. Then we define the Cayley graph given by this group and the set S to be the following graph, where V, the set of vertices, is just the set of group elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=270.3s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	And this is a very important construction of graphs. They have lots of nice properties And, in particular, an example of a Cayley graph is a Paley graph. They're not related. So a Paley graph is a special case of a Cayley graph obtained by considering the group, the cyclic group mod p, where p is prime 1 mod 4.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=334.12s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	So as in the expander mixing lemma. So the DISC property is that this quantity is small relative to the total number of edges. The second property, which we'll call the eigenvalue property, EIG, is that G is an n, d, lambda graph, with lambda, at most, epsilon d.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=1579.07s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	A is the matrix obtained by essentially taking the adjacency matrix and subtracting that constant there. And subtracting that constant gets rid of the top eigenvalue. And what you remained is whatever that's left.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=2521.57s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	So how small can lambda be. And it turns out there is a limit to how small it can be. And it is known as the Alon-Boppana bound, which tells you that if you have a fixed d-- and so G is an n-vertex graph with adjacency matrix eigenvalues lambda 1 through lambda n, sorted in non-increasing order.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=3084.54s
12. Pseudorandom graphs II: second eigenvalue	So let me remind you what this is. A wonder, has many combinatorial interpretations, and it's a fun exercise to do bijections between them. But, in particular, C3 is the equal to 5, which counts the number of ups and down walks of length 6 that never dip below the horizontal line where you start.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlvwagd2BmY#t=4493.86s
8. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma III: further applications	PROFESSOR: So we've been discussing Szemeredi's regularity level for the past couple of lectures. And one of the theorems that we proved was Roth's theorem, which tells us how large can a subset of 1 through N be if it has no 3-term arithmetic progressions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKLWa_0dhs#t=19.142s
8. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma III: further applications	Trivial corners, meaning the same point with d close to 0, so it's not a genuine corner like that. And in particular, in this graph, every edge is in a unique triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKLWa_0dhs#t=1644.16s
8. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma III: further applications	And I'm asking if you arbitrarily fix V3 through Vk, how many different choices are there to V1 and V2 in the two different settings. OK. So let A1 be the set of places where little v1 can go, if you already knew what V3 through Vk should be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKLWa_0dhs#t=3257.26s
8. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma III: further applications	But that turns out not to be an issue. So by counting lemma, the number of homomorphisms from H to G prime, where I'm really only considering homomorphisms that map each vertex of H to its assigned part.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKLWa_0dhs#t=4586.61s
8. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma III: further applications	And this is a phenomenon known as supersaturation, which you already saw in the first problem set, that often when you are beyond a certain threshold, an extremal threshold, you don't just gain one extra copy, but you often gain many copies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiKLWa_0dhs#t=4790.12s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	Then Bogolyubovs lemma says that 2a minus 2a contains a large bore set, of large structure within the situated subset. And last time we showed that the geometry of numbers, Minkowskis second term, one can deduce that every bore set of small dimension and small width contains-- of large width contains a proper GAP that's pretty large.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=301.2s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	"And let me tell you what the statement is. So the common generalization of GAP's and subgroups is something called a ""co-set progression."" So a co-set progression is a subset which is a direct sum of the form P plus H, where P is a proper GAP."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=2184.84s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	And this is that important construction for non-abelian groups. So it has a name. It's called a discrete Heisenberg group, which is the matrix group consisting of matrices that look like what I've written.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=2484.09s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	And to remind you, the definition of a nilpotent group is a group where the lower central series eventually terminates. In particular, inside that if you look at-- so this is the commutator of G, so look at all the elements that we recognize x, y, x inverse, y inverse-- the set of elements that can be written this way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=2837.97s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	And so let me define that. So given G, a finitely generated group, so generated by set S, we say that G has polynomial growth if the size S to the r grows like at most a polynomial in r.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=2947.16s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	"So virtually P means that there exists a finite index subgroup with property P. So ""virtually nilpotent"" means there is a finite index subgroup that is nilpotent. So it completely characterizes groups of polynomial growth."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=3126.03s
24. Structure of set addition IV: proof of Freiman's theorem	"So A contains a very large subspace. By ""subspace,"" I mean affine subspace. And the subspace here is comparable to the size of A itself. So you might wonder, if you don't care about containing A inside a single subspace, can you do much better in terms of bounds? And that's the content of the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwfCe-JZaI#t=3858.74s
9. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma IV: induced removal lemma	But first, recall the graph removal Lemma. In the graph removal Lemma, we have that for every graph H and epsilon bigger than zero, there exists some delta such that if an N vertex graph has fewer than delta and to the number of vertices of H, many copies of H, then it can be made H-free by removing fewer than epsilon N squared edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IxWLibV_tU#t=42.03s
9. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma IV: induced removal lemma	And you have this tester which is you sample some number of vertices. So this is called the oblivious tester. So you sample k vertices, and you try to see if it has that property.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IxWLibV_tU#t=4832.12s
9. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma IV: induced removal lemma	So there's a class of properties called hereditary. So hereditary properties are properties that are closed under vertex deletion. And these properties are-- lots of properties that you're seeing are of this form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IxWLibV_tU#t=4852.71s
9. Szemerédi's graph regularity lemma IV: induced removal lemma	In fact, it's testable in the above sense with a one-sided error using an oblivious tester. One-sided error means that up there if it's triangle-free, then it always succeeds. So here one of the cases that always succeeds.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IxWLibV_tU#t=4926.86s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	Now, Schur deduced his theorem from another result. That is known as Schur's Theorem, which says that if be positive integers is colored using finitely many colors, then there exists a monochromatic solution to the equation x plus y equals to z.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=192.71s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	So I start with this r. And let's suppose the conclusion were false. So supposed the conclusion were false, namely for every N there exists some coloring-- so for every N there exists some coloring-- which we will call phi sub N, that avoids monochromatic solutions to x plus y equals to z.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=441.15s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	This is truly a foundational result, a foundational theorem that gave way to a lot of important research. And Szemeredi himself received an Apple Prize for his seminal contributions to combinatorics and also theoretical computer science.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=2959.37s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	Let's look at other generalizations. So far, we are looking at linear patterns. So we're looking at linear dilations and translations. But what about polynomial patterns? So here's a question. Suppose I give you a dense subset, a positive density subset of integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=3518.72s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	So I need to say some hypotheses about these polynomials. So a vast generalization of this result, so known as polynomial Szemeredi theorem, says that if A is a subset of integers with positive density, and if we have these polynomials, P1 through Pk with integer coefficients and zero constant terms, then I can always find a pattern.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=3659.52s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	But no we're quite far from proving such a statement. And that's not what Green and Tao did. Instead, they took Szemeredi 's theorem as a black box and applied it to some variant of the primes and showed that inside this variant, Szemeredi 's theorem is also true, and that the primes sit inside this variant of the primes, known as pseudo primes, as a set of relatively positive density, but somehow transferring Szemeredi 's theorem from the dense setting to a sparser setting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=3902.1s
1. A bridge between graph theory and additive combinatorics	So Roth's theorem is the statement that every subset of integers 1 through n that avoids 3-term arithmetic progressions must have size little o of N. So earlier we gave an infinitary statement that if you have a positive density subset of the integers that it contains a three AP, this is an equivalent finitary statement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Py97IDg#t=4063.256s
25. Structure of set addition V: additive energy and Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem	So the additive energy is the number of quadruples of these elements where you have this additive relation. And we would like to understand sets with large additive energy. So, intuitively, if you have lots of solutions to this equation in your sets, then the sets themselves should have lots of internal additive structure.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlYhHsq_tOU#t=108.65s
25. Structure of set addition V: additive energy and Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem	So I'm going to state for you a graphical version of the Balog-Szemeredi-Gowers theorem. And it goes like this. If G is a bipartite graph between vertex sets A and B-- and here A and B are still subsets of the Abelian group-- we define this restricted sumset, A plus sub G of B, to be the set of sums where I'm only taking sums across edges in g.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlYhHsq_tOU#t=1181.89s
25. Structure of set addition V: additive energy and Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem	And there we used something called dependent random choice that had a conclusion that was very similar flavor. So there, we had every pair-- so a fairly large, but not as large as this-- a fairly large subset where every pair of elements had lots of common neighbors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlYhHsq_tOU#t=2189.54s

Maths for Programmers: Introduction (What Is Discrete Mathematics?)	In this video, I will be explaining what Discrete Mathematics is, and why it's important for the field of Computer Science and Programming. Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or finite sets of elements rather than continuous or infinite sets of elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfX2xW3104#t=0.26s
Maths for Programmers: Introduction (What Is Discrete Mathematics?)	The simplest example is with a circle. A circle by definition is an infinite number of points equally distant from a fixed point. The problem with this is that if we try to write a program that prints out all of these points, it will run forever because there is an infinite number of points and therefore an infinite number of executions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfX2xW3104#t=40.659s
Precalculus Course	This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges. A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values and output numbers, usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output number. Sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine, in which you can feed in x values as input and get out y values as output. So, non mathematical example of a function might be the biological mother function, which takes as input and a person, and it gives us output their biological mother.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=18.09s
Precalculus Course	So I can say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the y axis. If whenever a point x, y is on the graph, the point negative x, y is also on the graph. Finally, a graph is symmetric with respect to the origin if it has 180 degree rotational symmetry around the origin. This means that if I spin it by 180 degrees, the graph should line up exactly with itself. Rotating a graph by 180 degrees is the same thing as turning it upside down.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=1726.409s
Precalculus Course	Finally, g of minus x means the square root of minus x. This might look a little odd, because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number. But remember that if x itself is negative, like negative to the negative x will be negative negative two or positive two. So we're really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case, let me record which of these are inside and which of these are outside of my function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=2712.6s
Precalculus Course	For a right triangle, with sides of length A, B, and C angle theta as drawn, we define sine of theta as the length of the opposite side over the hypothesis, the side that's opposite to our angle theta has measure a and I have partners is this side here with measure C. So that would be a oversee for this triangle. Cosine of theta is defined as the length of the adjacent side, over the length of hi partners. This side here is the side adjacent to theta. Of course, the hypothesis is also adjacent to theta, but it's special as a partner, so we don't think of it as the adjacent side. So that would be B oversea.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=5597.44s
Precalculus Course	And so that's one of the special angles that has an x coordinate of one half a y coordinate of negative root three over two. And therefore sine of negative 60 is negative root three over two the y coordinate. The next property I call the even odd property, it says that cosine is an even function, which means that cosine of negative theta is the same thing as cosine of theta, while sine is an odd function, which means that sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta. To see why this is true, let's look at an angle theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=7078.689s
Precalculus Course	Therefore, sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta. Let's figure out if tan of theta isn't even or odd function. Well, we know that 10 of negative theta tangent by definition, is sine over cosine. Well, we know that sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta, whereas cosine of negative theta is cosine of theta. Therefore We're getting negative sine theta over cosine theta, which is negative tan of theta. Since tan of negative theta is the negative of tan of theta, tan theta is an odd function. The last property on this video is the Pythagorean property, which says that cosine of theta squared plus sine of theta squared is equal to one. A lot of times this property is written with this shorthand notation, cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=7167.079s
Precalculus Course	Recall that solving a right triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all the measures of the angles from partial information. The Law of Cosines is a tool that can help us solve triangles that are not necessarily right triangles. We call it the Pythagorean theorem says that for a right triangle, like this one, c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared. I like to think of the law of cosines. As a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem, two triangles that are not necessarily right triangles. loosely speaking, the Law of Cosines says that c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared plus a correction factor where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's opposite sides see, in this first triangle, on the left, the angle opposite to side C is a right angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw#t=14484.47s
Maths for Programmers: Sets (Interval Notation & Common Sets)	Likewise, if we wanted to say that X is greater than or equal to Zero and X is less than 1 then we have to switch this to a square bracket. All we're doing is we're now including the number Zero in the interval. Also we can include Zero and we can also include 1 in the interval by using square brackets on both sides. So it's greater than or equal and less than or equal to. And now talk about some common sets, the first one being the null set, which is the same thing as the empty set, which is just there are no elements contained within the set and this will come in handy future. The funny N here is the natural numbers, which is the set containing elements 1, 2, 3, and then these thre e dots here called an ellipsis, which tells us that the pattern continues. So, N is the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 all the way up to infinity. This funny N with a Zero is the natural numbers, however it includes the value Zero within the set. So it's 0, 1, 2 in the ellipsis tells us all the way to infinity in an integer Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And finally, we have all the integers positive and negative and non which is Zero, negative 1, negative 2 all the way down to negative infinity, and Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way up to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz43uTVTolY#t=33.63s
Maths for Programmers: Introduction (Tips For Learning)	If no one is around, or you feel weird talking to yourself then you can try and explain it to a rubber ducky. There's a concept in Programming called Rubber Ducky debugging, which is where programmers go through their code, line by line, trying to identify bugs in their code by explaining it to a rubber ducky.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSBC3n9x52Q#t=56.17s
Maths for Programmers: Logic (Composite Propositions)	in this video I'll be introducing the concept of composite propositions just like regular propositions composite propositions are declarative statements with a verifiable truth value composite propositions are made up of sub propositions and in this video we're going to talk about the conjunction and the disjunction so the first one i want to introduce is the conjunction that is p and cute that's how you would read this P and Q and so this composite proposition here is rain falls from the sky and Ghana is a country in Asia so the two sub propositions in this would be P P and Q and this has a verifiable truth value because rain falls from the sky because that is a true statement but the statement q Ghana is a country in Asia is false we have P and Q we have true and false which means that it's false one of them is false and we'll talk about this more when we get into truth tables the next is the disjunction P or Q that's read as or rain falls from the sky or Ghana is a country in Asia so again we have true or false this time so only one of these need to be true in order for everything to be true and therefore P or Q is a true statement	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQHcQNRUQiY#t=0.03s
College Algebra - Full Course	This video is about the exponent rules, rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth, or x to the n. two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times two, written five times. And similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself. And times when we write these expressions, the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself is called the base. And the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying the base by itself is called the exponent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=17.68s
College Algebra - Full Course	Sometimes the exponent is also called the power. The product rule says that a 5x to the power of n times x to the power of m, that's the same thing as x to the n plus m power. In other words, when I multiply two expressions with the same base, then I can add their exponents.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=58.28s
College Algebra - Full Course	I'll start by reviewing the exponent rules. The product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add the exponents. The quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents. The power rule says that when you take a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. The power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power is one, as long as the base is not zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=621.36s
College Algebra - Full Course	This example asks us to rationalize the denominator, that means to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator. To get rid of the radical sine and the denominator, I want to multiply my denominator by square root of x. But I can't just multiply the denominator willy nilly by something unless I multiply the numerator by the same thing. So then just multiply my expression by one in a fancy forum and I don't change the value of my expression.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=1824.79s
College Algebra - Full Course	But for right now, I just want to review how I can go backwards how I can check that the factoring is correct. And that's just by multiplying out or distributing. If I distribute x plus two times x plus three, then I multiply x by x, that gives me x squared, x times three gives me 3x. Two times x gives me 2x. And two times three gives me six. So that simplifies to x squared plus 5x plus six, which checks out with what I started with. So you can think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out. And you can always check your factoring by distributing or multiplying out a bit of terminology, when I think of an expression as a sum of a bunch of things, then the things I sum up are called the terms. But if I think of the same expression as a product of things, then the things that I multiply together are called factors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=1943.7s
College Algebra - Full Course	Now let's get started on techniques of factoring. When I have to factor something, I always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor, the greatest common factor means the largest thing that divides each of the terms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=2002.93s
College Algebra - Full Course	Next, we'll do some factoring of quadratics. a quadratic is an expression with a squared term, just a term with x in it, and a constant term with no x's in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=2226.079s
College Algebra - Full Course	Adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated because we first have to find a common denominator. A common denominator is an expression that both denominators divided into, it's usually best of the long run to use the least common denominator, which is the smallest expression that both denominators divided into.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=3552.66s
College Algebra - Full Course	This video is about solving rational equations. A rational equation, like this one is an equation that has rational expressions in that, in other words, an equation that has some variables in the denominator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=4523.0s
College Algebra - Full Course	Since the denominators don't have any factors in common, I can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together. My next step is going to be clearing the denominator. By this, I mean that I multiply both sides of my equation by this least common denominator, x plus three times x, I multiply on the left side of the equation, and I multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=4552.35s
College Algebra - Full Course	This video is about solving radical equations, that is equations like this one that have square root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical. When I see an equation with a square root in it, I really want to get rid of the square root. But it'll be easiest to get rid of the square root. If I first isolate the square root. In other words, I want to get the term with the square root and that on one side of the equation by itself, and everything else on the other side of the equation. If I start with my original equation, x plus the square root of x equals 12. And I subtract x from both sides, then that does isolate the square root term on the left side with everything else on the right. Once I've isolated the term with the square root, I want to get rid of the square root. And I'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation. So I'll take the square root of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=5130.67s
College Algebra - Full Course	This video is about solving radical equations, that is equations like this one that have square root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical. In this video, we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign, or the fractional exponent, and then removing the radical sine or the fractional exponent by either squaring both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=5787.86s
College Algebra - Full Course	This video is about solving linear inequalities. Those are inequalities like this one that involve a variable here x, but don't involve any x squared or other higher power terms. The good news is, we can solve linear inequalities, just like we solve linear equations by distributing, adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying and dividing by numbers on both sides. The only thing that's different is that if you multiply or divide by a negative number, then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if we had the inequality, negative x is less than negative five, and we wanted to multiply both sides by negative one to get rid of the negative signs, we'd have to also switch or reverse the inequality. With this caution in mind, let's look at our first example.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=7015.88s
College Algebra - Full Course	Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line. So I write down negative two and two, those are the places where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=7692.58s
College Algebra - Full Course	And then a minus in here, because we're finding the difference between the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides. The midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment, as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=8451.63s
College Algebra - Full Course	A function is a correspondence between input numbers usually the x values and output numbers, usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output number. Sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in x values as input and get out y values as output. So, non mathematical example of a function might be the biological mother function, which takes as input any person and it gives us output their biological mother.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=10149.989s
College Algebra - Full Course	The domain of a function is all possible x values that makes sense for that function. The range is the y values that make sense for the function. In this example, we saw that the x value of five didn't have a corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five is not in the domain of our function J. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at the x values that correspond to points on the graph. One way to do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the x axis and see what x values are hit. It looks like we're hitting all x values starting at negative eight, and continuing up to four. So our domain is the x's between negative eight, and four, including those endpoints. Or we can write this in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=10467.67s
College Algebra - Full Course	a quadratic function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals A x squared plus bx plus c, where a, b and c are real numbers. And a is not equal to zero. The reason we require that A is not equal to zero is because if a were equal to zero, we'd have f of x is equal to b x plus c, which is called a linear function. So by making sure that a is not zero, we make sure there's really an x squared term which is the hallmark of a quadratic function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=12029.521s
College Algebra - Full Course	The vertex of a parabola is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards, and its highest point if it's pointing downwards. So in this case, the vertex is at 00. The x intercepts are where the graph crosses the x axis. In other words, where y is zero In this function, y equals zero means that x squared is zero, which happens only when x is zero. So the x intercept, there's only one of them is also zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=12280.739s
College Algebra - Full Course	Since this function is written in standard form, On the Y equals a x plus a squared plus bx plus c form, and not in vertex form, we can't just read off the vertex like we couldn't before. But there's a trick called the vertex formula, which says that whenever you have a function in a quadratic function in standard form, the vertex has an x coordinate of negative B over two A. So in this case, that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over two times five or negative one, which is kind of like where I put it on the graph. To find the y coordinate of that vertex, I can just plug in negative one into my equation for x, which gives me at y equals five times negative one squared, plus 10, times negative one plus three, which is negative two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=12596.97s

College Algebra - Full Course	Remember, when you're sketching graphs are recognizing graphs of polynomials. The end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look, as x gets bigger and bigger heads towards infinity, or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers towards negative infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=13468.629s
College Algebra - Full Course	This video is about exponential functions and their graphs. an exponential function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x, where a and b are any real numbers. As long as a is not zero, and B is positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=13746.189s
College Algebra - Full Course	The number A in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the initial value. And the number B is called the base. The phrase initial value comes from the fact that if we plug in x equals zero, we get a times b to the zero, well, anything to the zero is just one. So this is equal to A. In other words, f of zero equals a. So if we think of starting out, when x equals zero, we get the y value of a, that's why it's called the initial value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=13869.729s
College Algebra - Full Course	Let's start out with this example, where y equals a times b to the x next special function, and we've set a equal to one and B equals a two. Notice that the y intercept, the value when x is zero, is going to be one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=13911.629s
College Algebra - Full Course	In this video, we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems, simple annual interest, interest compounded and times per year, and continuously compounded interest. This video introduces logarithms. logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base a of B equals c means that a to the C equals b. In other words, log base a of B is the exponent that you raise a to to get BE THE NUMBER A It is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write it in this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship. log base a of B equals c means a to the C equals b, by drawing arrows, a to the C equals b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=16158.43s
College Algebra - Full Course	So I will copy down the ln of x plus one times x minus one, and rewrite this second term as ln of x squared minus one squared. Now I have a straightforward difference of two logs, which I can rewrite as the log of a quotient. I can actually simplify this some more. Since x plus one times x minus one is the same thing as x squared minus one. I can cancel factors to get ln of one over x squared minus one. In this video, we saw four rules for logs that are related to exponent rules. First, we saw that the log with any base of one is equal to zero. Second, we saw the product rule, the log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs. We saw the quotient rule, the log of a quotient is the difference of the logs. And we saw the power rule. When you take a log of an expression with an exponent in it, you can bring down the exponent and multiply it. It's worth noticing that there's no log rule that helps you split up the log of a psalm. In particular, the log of a psalm is not equal to the sum of the logs. If you think about logs and exponent rules going together, this kind of makes sense, because there's also no rule for rewriting the sum of two exponential expressions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=18015.67s
College Algebra - Full Course	But what's Ed Oh, and two, E and ln undo each other, so that's just 350 times two to the 1/15 to the T TA, the equations are really the same. And these, you'll always be able to find two different versions of an exponential equation, sort of the standard one, a times b to the T, or the continuous growth one, a times e to the RT. In this last example, we're going to work with half life, half life is pretty much like doubling time, it just means the amount of time that it takes for a quantity to decrease to half as much as we originally started with, we're told that the half life of radioactive carbon 14 is 5750 years. So that means it takes that long for a quantity of radioactive carbon 14 to decay, so that you just have half as much left and the rest is nonradioactive form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=19810.51s
College Algebra - Full Course	So we're told a sample of bone that originally contained 200 grams of radioactive carbon 14 now contains only 40 grams, we're supposed to find out how old the sample is, is called carbon dating. Let's use the continuous growth model this time. So our final amount, so this is our amount of radioactive c 14 is going to be the initial amount times e to the RT, we could have used the other model to we could have used f of t equals a times b to the T, but I just want to use the continuous model for practice. So we know that our half life is 5750. So what that means is when t is 5750, our amount is going to be one half of what we started with. Let me see if I can plug that into my equation and figure out use that to figure out what r is. That's ours called the continuous growth rate.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=19876.808s
College Algebra - Full Course	That kind of makes sense in terms of the half life because to get from 200 to 40 you have to decrease by half a little more than two times right or increasing by half once would get you to 100 decreasing to half again would get you to 50 a little more than 40 and two half lives is getting pretty close to 13,000 years. This video introduced a lot of new things it introduced continue Less growth model, which is another equivalent way of writing an exponential function. The relationship is that the B in this example, is the same thing as EDR. In that version, it also introduced the ideas of doubling time. And HalfLife the amount of time it takes a quantity to double or decreased to half in an exponential growth model. Recall that a linear equation is equation like for example, 2x minus y equals one. It's an equation without any x squared or y squared in it, something that could be rewritten in the form y equals mx plus b, the equation for a line a system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations. For example, I could have these two equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=20075.51s
College Algebra - Full Course	Recall that a rational function is a function that can be written as a ratio or quotient of two power. No Here's an example. The simpler function, f of x equals one over x is also considered a rational function, you can think of one and x as very simple polynomials. The graph of this rational function is shown here. This graph looks different from the graph of a polynomial. For one thing, its end behavior is different. The end behavior of a function is the way the graph looks when x goes through really large positive, or really large negative numbers, we've seen that the end behavior of a polynomial always looks like one of these cases. That is why marches off to infinity or maybe negative infinity, as x gets really big or really negative. But this rational function has a different type of end behavior.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=21593.16s
College Algebra - Full Course	Notice, as x gets really big, the y values are leveling off at about a y value of three. And similarly, as x values get really negative, our graph is leveling off near the line y equals three, I'll draw that line, y equals three on my graph, that line is called a horizontal asymptote. A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that our graph gets closer and closer to as x goes to infinity, or as X goes to negative infinity, or both. There's something else that's different about this graph from a polynomial graph, look at what happens as x gets close to negative five. As we approach negative five with x values on the right, our Y values are going down towards negative infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=21650.2s
College Algebra - Full Course	inverse functions, reverse the roles of y and x. The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose F with F inverse, we get the identity function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with F, that brings x to x. In other words, F and F inverse undo each other. The function f of x has an inverse function if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test. And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse and the range of f is the domain of f inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU#t=24148.56s

In fact, for a long time people believe that all numbers are rational and it's actually quite natural to do so.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=78.39s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	And so to start with there is really no reason to suspect that there exist irrational numbers, numbers that cannot be written as fractions. But of course you probably all know that root 2 and the golden ratio are irrational numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=115.229s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	These two irrationals as well as the fractions are examples of algebraic numbers. Those are the numbers that come up naturally in algebra as solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. For example, the fraction 22 over 7 is the solution to this linear equation there and root 2 is one of the two solutions of this quadratic equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=129.509s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	In any case, a very natural question to ask is whether there are any numbers that are not algebraic, in other words whether there are transcendental numbers, numbers that transcend the world generated by algebra.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=200.079s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	The fact that made this neat construction possible was that the rational numbers can be listed like this. Infinite sets of numbers that can be listed like this are called countably infinite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=417.06s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	Okay, here then is a quick sketch of how you can list the algebraic numbers. We've already listed the fractions, that is, the solutions to all linear equations with integer coefficients A B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=508.289s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	In fact, it's not very hard to make up your own method if your life should ever depend on it, you know, might happen :) Okay, after we've listed the rational numbers we'll list the quadratic irrational and these are the solutions of quadratic equations with three integer coefficients A, B and C now.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=531.839s
Transcendental numbers powered by Cantor's infinities	As I said this is just one way to list the algebraic numbers, there are infinitely many others. Cantor diagonalization translates the one i've chosen into a transcendental number that starts out like this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xyYs_eQTUc#t=616.62s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	On the other hand, the diagram at the bottom  records the speedometer reading over time. Also the Mathologer mobile is a vintage sports  car with a mechanical odometer which winds backwards when the car moves in reverse.  And, if I just move backwards beyond 0, the place where I started recording, I’ll  record distance as negative distance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=433.04s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	As well, the process of translating the  function on top into the one at the bottom is called differentiating. Remember, differential calculus? Now let’s start by making the  function f one of our favourite functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=749.04s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	To make new functions from old  ones for starters we’ll only add, subtract, multiply, divide and substitute. Cool. Here is an example, Those basic atom functions up there, plus the  complicated functions that can be constructed like this from them are called the elementary  functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=861.2s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	What’s the function at the top? Well, easy.  We just have to find the anti-derivative of x squared, that is, the function whose  derivative is x squared. For that let’s have a look at the list of derivatives of our  basic building blocks. Maybe we get lucky.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=1186.0s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	And translating up or down means adding  some constant to sine. So, can you see that what we see in front of us stays  true if we add a constant to sine? Obvious, right? Just unleash the sum rule which says that the derivative of a sum  is the sum of the derivatives.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=1355.76s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	Anyway, there is one more aspect to calculus  that really makes it unusually user friendly and that aspect is notation, the nifty way  in which we express calculus in symbols. This miracle notation was introduced by Gottfried  Willhelm Leibniz and was further streamlined over the years.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=1667.04s
Why is calculus so ... EASY ?	These snapshots also feature  that second main ingredient of Leibniz notation the integral sign, that elongated S, Leibniz’s  way to denote the anti-derivative. Enjoy. The derivative of one function  subbed into another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOxDh3egN0#t=1895.04s
Why don't they teach Newton's calculus of 'What comes next?'	Okay, we’ve discovered a cool trick for trying to  decipher what’s-next IQ puzzles, but of course we’re not done yet. What we would really like is  a simple rule, a formula for our mystery sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AuV93LOPcE#t=190.24s
Why don't they teach Newton's calculus of 'What comes next?'	Now let me  show you the Gregory-Newton formula in action, the super simple procedure  for finding a polynomial rule that fits the sequence at the top.  Ready to be amazed? Here we go.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AuV93LOPcE#t=978.08s
Why don't they teach Newton's calculus of 'What comes next?'	"Very nice. What we’ve isolated here is a  *difference* equation. The Fibonacci sequence is the solution of this difference equation  together with the “initial values"" 0 and 1. The nifties part is that you can also solve this  difference equation pretty much exactly as the corresponding, WARNING BIG WORDS COMING UP BUT  DON’T WORRY ABOUT THEM, … you can solve this difference equation pretty much exactly like  a linear second order homogeneous differential equation."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AuV93LOPcE#t=2066.24s
Irrational Roots	These are the ultimate irrationality zappers, the master tools for deciding whether rooty numbers like the ones over there are rational or irrational. Many of you will have glimpsed these irrationality zappers in school though probably with different packaging.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6AFxJdJYW4#t=73.35s
Irrational Roots	That's pretty easy. Anyway the real numbers solutions to polynomial equations like this are super important and have a special name. They're called the algebraic numbers. Numbers that are not algebraic such as e and pi are called transcendental numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6AFxJdJYW4#t=498.82s
Irrational Roots	These algorithms have also been implemented as part of computer algebra systems. For example, in Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha the relevant command is Minimal Polynomial. In fact, unleashing this command on a rooty number will spit out a special polynomial, an extra special polynomial, the so called minimal polynomial, that is, a polynomial of lowest possible degree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6AFxJdJYW4#t=588.91s
Heron’s formula: What is the hidden meaning of 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 x 2 x 3 ?	Who was Heron? Heron of Alexandria, as he is usually called, was a Greek mathematician and engineer who lived from about 10 AD to 70 AD and who’s been called the greatest experimentalist of antiquity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IguNXoCjBEk#t=385.85s
Math is Illuminati confirmed	In total nine points you can probably already see. There is three more super Illuminati triangles, equilateral triangles orbiting every triangle. (Giuseppe) They are everywhere. They are everywhere but actually I ran out of steam, I did not animate this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfnBW6HvNwM#t=301.57s
Math is Illuminati confirmed	It's called the winter triangle. The winter triangle is an equilateral triangle up in the skies. I don't know how the Illuminati got it there. Pretty, pretty amazing but there is a clue.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfnBW6HvNwM#t=527.59s
How did Fibonacci beat the Solitaire army?	Here is a quick reminder of  how you play the basic game. A move in peg solitaire consists of jumping with  one peg over an adjacent peg into a hole. And then removing the peg we jumped over.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPa0FA65Fk#t=201.84s
What is the best way to lace your shoes? Dream proof.	I call such lacings tight. in other words in a tight lacing every segment of the closed path connects the two sides of the shoe and there are no vertical segments at all.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSw3Wqoim5M#t=201.45s
What is the best way to lace your shoes? Dream proof.	see I'm not the only one. now what about general lacings. here it turns out the absolutely shortest lacing is always what I call a bowtie lacing. bowtie lacings have horizontal segments at the top and at the bottom and the rest of the segments come in pairs, either making short parallel pairs like this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSw3Wqoim5M#t=427.749s
What is the best way to lace your shoes? Dream proof.	there that's all of them. the Traveling Salesman problem asks for a shortest round trip that visits every one of these cities once. here is the solution to this problem. and here's the solution of the same problem for more than 18,000 towns in Germany.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSw3Wqoim5M#t=534.819s
The Secret of Parabolic Ghosts	The point is called the focus and the line is called directrix of the parabola. What's special is that every point on the parabola is exactly the same distance from the focus and the directrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UapiTAxMXE#t=108.689s
2000 years unsolved: Why is doubling cubes and squaring circles impossible?	Then, as we've seen, we can construct midpoints. These are the  integer multiples of 1/2.  There are more midpoints here. This gives all the integer multiples of 1/4, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1sPvUr0YC0#t=719.3s
The ARCTIC CIRCLE THEOREM or Why do physicists play dominoes?	So the regularly tiled regions in the corners are called  the frozen regions. Okay. And the boundary of the chaotic region in the middle is called the arctic  circle. In fact the arctic circle theorem says that if you push all this to infinity this is  the picture you get.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7Q8IWNfHM#t=1134.4s
Pi is IRRATIONAL: animation of a gorgeous proof	I just couldn't resist. Anyway let's get started. As a little warm-up let me show you what is probably the simplest irrationality proof, a proof of the irrationality of log 3. If log 3 was actually a fraction u/v that would be the same as saying that if I take 10 to the power of u/v then I get 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk_QF_hcM8A#t=96.78s
Euler's real identity NOT e to the i pi = -1	Of course it's really sad for Roger Cotes since he doesn't get mentioned for anything and nobody's ever heard of him. Anyway I thought I make a video about the real Euler identity, the identity that made Euler into a mathematical celebrity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPl64xi_ZZA#t=35.0s
Euler's real identity NOT e to the i pi = -1	It's this one here. Very curious, right? It says that pi squared over six is equal to the infinite sum of the reciprocals of the squares. This identity is a very surprising answer to the problem of whether the infinite sum on the right adds up to anything nice.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPl64xi_ZZA#t=50.7s
Euler's real identity NOT e to the i pi = -1	Up there is the definition of the famous Riemann zeta function which is the function at the heart of the Riemann hypothesis, one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. So what Euler managed to do was to find the precise value of the Riemann zeta function at 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPl64xi_ZZA#t=100.86s
Euler's real identity NOT e to the i pi = -1	Solving for pi divided by 2 gives the so called Wallis product, named after the mathematician John Walli, a really beautiful and useful infinite product featuring squares of all the even numbers in the numerator and squares of all the odd numbers in the denominator, really really nice in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPl64xi_ZZA#t=938.87s
Root 2 and the deadly Marching Squares	We basically start with an assumption that we can find the smallest example, but that shows us, this kind of paradox this contradiction shows us. there can't be a smallest example. So there is actually no way to merge two [identical] squares into a larger square So that's what we're just shown it's actually in mathematics is called a proof by contradiction You assume that something is the case okay? And then you make logical deductions until you come to a point where you can see there's some nonsense here But from something that's true Nonsense can't follow so that means that what you started with has to be [nonsense] in the first place and it means that whatever is the opposite of what you assumed has to be true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1yDExNAEMg#t=365.75s
The cube shadow theorem (pt.2): The best hypercube shadows	That maximal shadow,  that maximal 3d shadow of a 6D unit hypercube looks like this and it's got a name. It's a very famous shape in geometry, it's called a rhombic triacontahedron.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEhLNS5AHss#t=515.289s
The golden ratio spiral: visual infinite descent	We start with a root 3 rectangle like this one here. A root 3 rectangle is a rectangle with sides A and B whose aspect ratio A over B is equal to root 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubHVK71F01M#t=248.98s
The golden ratio spiral: visual infinite descent	For example, the amazing pattern in the continued fraction of the number e, the continued fraction of pi, and the curious observation that the golden ratio, the number was the simplest spiral and continued fraction, is the most irrational number, etc. And that's it for today.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubHVK71F01M#t=1271.45s
New Reuleaux Triangle Magic	But as well as this defining property, shapes of constant widths have a number of other non-obvious and very interesting properties. My absolute favourite among these properties is Barbier's theorem. This theorem says that all, absolutely all shapes of the same constant width also have the same perimeter as the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eQaF6OmWKw#t=525.49s
Euler's and Fermat's last theorems, the Simpsons and CDC6600	Just as a reminder, Fermat's Last Theorem says that the equation over there has no solutions in positive integers A, B, C as long as the exponent n is an integer greater than 2, so not possible if n is 3 or 4 or 5, etc.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO-W5aEJ3Wg#t=23.72s
The Korean king's magic square: a brilliant algorithm in a k-drama (plus geomagic squares)	Pretty amazing, right? In fact, these large numbers of solutions for different magic constant shapes prompt another question: Is there perhaps a BI-magic square? A set of tiles that has two completely different magic constant shapes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FANbncTMCGc#t=1789.35s
Fermat’s HUGE little theorem, pseudoprimes and Futurama	Welcome to a special Halloween edition of Mathologer. Recently I did a video on Fermat's mega famous Last Theorem Fermat's theorem says that the pretty Pythagorean integer identities like 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared or 5 squared plus 12 squared equals 13 squared don't have nontrivial counterparts if the exponent 2 is replaced by any integer greater than 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9fbBSxhkuA#t=4.7s
Fermat’s HUGE little theorem, pseudoprimes and Futurama	None of our Fermat's little theorem tests will show that 561 is composite. Numbers like 561 which Fermat's little theorem cannot distinguish from primes are called Fermat pseudoprimes or Carmichael numbers, named after the American mathematician Robert Daniel Carmichael.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9fbBSxhkuA#t=716.12s
Visualising Pythagoras: ultimate proofs and crazy contortions	One remarkable thing about Pythagoras is the existence of Pythagorean triples. These are triples of positive integers A, B, C such that A squared plus B squared equals C squared, like, for example, 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-0SOWbzUYI#t=875.8s
Indeterminate: the hidden power of 0 divided by 0	That seems a bit strange but just remember that equation that corresponds to 0/0 has all numbers as solutions so what really happens here is that we've established a context, a very narrow context in which 0/0 kind of makes sense as one particular number and you can see that as the context changes we get different numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc0M1o8tuPo#t=183.5s
Riemann's paradox:     pi = infinity minus infinity	So we just saw that we can rearrange this series into another series with a different sum, and actually there's a famous mathematician, Riemann, Bernhard Riemann, who came up with a theorem, the Riemann rearrangement theorem, which says that, well, in this case of this particular series, you can rearrange this thing into series that add up to anything you want.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EtHF5ND3_s#t=229.26s
Riemann's paradox:     pi = infinity minus infinity	So let's just do it, but before we do it,  I really have to remind you of what it actually means for one of those series to add up to a certain number, okay, so what we do is we translate this, series, into a sequence of numbers, the 'partial sums', the sequence of partial sums.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EtHF5ND3_s#t=292.52s
Riemann's paradox:     pi = infinity minus infinity	A series that actually has a sum which is a finite number. Ah, now there's also lots of series that don't converge. And they are called 'divergent'. So for example, if we replace all the minuses in here by pluses, I already showed in that other video up there, that this adds up to +∞.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EtHF5ND3_s#t=349.3s
Toroflux paradox: making things (dis)appear with math	In fact, the toroflux is what mathematicians refer to as a torus knot, a closed loop that lies on the surface of a torus. There are infinitely many different torus knots. Here are just three examples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK7XR-wlpAk#t=1000.739s
Toroflux paradox: making things (dis)appear with math	In the case of a trefoil knot this number is 3 and for our windy, knotty, rainbowy example the number turns out to be 15. The second number associated with a torus knot is the number of times you loop around the point in the very middle as you travel once along the knot.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK7XR-wlpAk#t=1069.98s
Visualising irrationality with triangular squares	And it's all based on what I usually refer to as triangular squares. What the hell is a triangular square? Well, it's definitely not clickbait. Okay what I mean by triangular squares are equilateral triangles that are made up of mini equilateral triangles like that one over there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk6wbvNPZW0#t=38.98s
Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics	And that circle reflects the light right, so we switch on the light over there and then well what happens? Well light rays emanate in all kinds of directions and get reflected off the circle bounce around and you can see this pattern emerging, the cardioid.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8#t=635.96s
The PROOF: e and pi are transcendental	And what comes after quadratics? Everything. Saying e is transcendental means that e is not the solution of any non-trivial polynomial equation with integer coefficients. This was first proved in 1873 by the great French mathematician Charles Hermite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyoH_vgiqXM#t=605.82s
Why did they prove this amazing theorem in 200 different ways? Quadratic Reciprocity MASTERCLASS	Okay, what's the big deal wit that? Who cares.  Well I definitely care, A LOT. I mean this is 100 hours later of doing this stuff. Quadratic reciprocity is a very powerful, amazingly simple and astonishing out-of-nowhere relationship between pairs of primes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X63MWZIN3gM#t=1151.53s
Why did they prove this amazing theorem in 200 different ways? Quadratic Reciprocity MASTERCLASS	Third column, fourth column, fifth column. So by picking up the cards by row and then placing them back down by column we've changed the order of the cards. This amounts to a permutation,  a reordering of the numbers 1 to 15.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X63MWZIN3gM#t=1579.12s
Why did they prove this amazing theorem in 200 different ways? Quadratic Reciprocity MASTERCLASS	And what is that power that gives the sign? It is the number of what I call the inversions of the permutation. An inversion is any pair of numbers in the permutation where the first number is higher than the second so in that permutation there the seven comes before the 2 that's an inversion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X63MWZIN3gM#t=1871.48s
Death by infinity puzzles and the Axiom of Choice	The most famous example is the Banach-Tarski paradox. It says that a solid ball can be split into finitely many disjoint sets like this which can subsequently be pushed and rotated around in space such that they recombine into two solids balls of exactly the same size as the one we started with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDOP0XynAzA#t=697.499s
Power sum MASTER CLASS: How to sum quadrillions of powers ... by hand! (Euler-Maclaurin formula)	Following little Gauss and not-so-little Bernoulli, it's now Euler's turn. One of Euler's amazing and most famous achievements was the solution of the so-called Basel problem, the evaluation of the sum over there of the reciprocals of squares in terms of pi.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw1kRz83Fj0#t=2531.05s
The ultimate tower of Hanoi algorithm	Well the regulars among you will recognize these numbers  straight away these are just the triangular numbers, numbers that can be written in the form  1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 is 6 plus 4 is 10, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbonokcLbNo#t=1458.28s
Mental Math: Division Using Compensation	Welcome to a video on a mental math strategy often referred to as compensation. Compensation in math is the process of reformulating an addition and subtraction multiplication or division problem to one that can be computed more easily mentally.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjB8bIafhIk#t=0.03s
Dividing Whole Numbers	Division of whole numbers means we will take a certain number of items and split them up into groups. So six divided by two means we have six items and we want to divide these into two groups.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwTPFqWfosM#t=27.057s
Dividing Whole Numbers	Therefore six divided by two is equal to three. The number being divided is called the dividend. So in this problem six is the dividend. The number we are dividing by is called the divisor.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwTPFqWfosM#t=53.016s
Multiply Whole Numbers to Solve Applications	There are 36 women in the choir. For our last example, Rene's driveway is a rectangle 45 feet long by 20 feet wide. What is the area of the driveway? The area of a rectangle is equal to length times width.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTX4pVOblnA#t=154.865s
Ex: Division Using Partial Quotient - Four Digit Divided by One Digit (No Remainder)	One hundred ninety-six times seven equals one thousand, three hundred seventy-two. The quotient times the divisor equals the dividend.

Determine the Amount of Interest Earned (Simple Interest)	Treasury Notes or T-notes are bonds issued by the federal government to cover expenses. Suppose you obtain a $5000 T-note with 3% annual interest, with maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? Assume the T-note pays simple interest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVmetUlbheY#t=0.57s
Solving Two Step Equations (Basic)	The second step is to multiply or divide in order to isolate the variable and solve the equation. Negative 2x means negative 2 times x, so to undo this multiplication, the next step is to divide both sides by negative 2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyxSVQKeRw#t=195.0s
Solve an Equation with Fractions and Variables on Both Sides (Clear Fractions)	We're going to solve the equation 4/5ths x minus five halves equals negative 9/10ths x minus seven. The solution is a value of x that satisfies the equation which means the solution is a value of x that makes the expression on the left equal to the expression on the right.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCvEUXvBE8s#t=0.906s
Solve an Equation with Fractions and Variables on Both Sides (Clear Fractions)	In this video, we'll be solving the equation by first clearing the fractions from the equation. Let's see if we can identify the least common denominator. The least common denominator is the least common multiple of five, two, and 10, which is also the smallest number best divisible by five, two, and 10.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCvEUXvBE8s#t=37.318s
Ex: Solve a Basic Two Step Equation With Decimals (Clear Decimals)	The solution to this equation will be the same solution to the original equation. And because we can solve for x in two steps, this is often called a two step equation where the next step is to isolate the variable term by adding or subtracting.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc74lLdtPrU#t=114.417s
Ex 5: Solving a Two Step Equation with Fractions - Clearing the Fractions	Now, once we have the denominators in prime factored form, as long as the denominators contain the same prime factors, we can build the least common denominator. The least common denominator would be the least common multiple of five, two, and three, which is also the smallest number divisible by five, two, and three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXC_6NwqaQ#t=85.072s
Ex 2: Solving a Two Step Equation with Fractions - NOT Clearing the Fractions	The least common denominator will be the least common multiple of 4 and 6 or the smallest number that's divisible by both 4 and 6. Looking at the multiples of 4 and 6 below, notice that 12 is the least common multiple of 4 and 6; therefore, the least common denominator will be 12.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SOa81HhSjw#t=102.736s
Solve a Linear Equation in One Variable (Traditional) 15-3x=36	We need to be careful here because the negative three and the x are attached by multiplication. Negative three x means negative three times x. And, therefore, to undo the multiplication and solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by negative three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izxaV0yTQb8#t=100.726s

Solve Linear Equations in One Variable with Simplifying (One-Step Mult/Div)	We will take a look at one example where the equation does not have parentheses and a second example with an equation that does have parentheses. The solution to an equation is a value of the variable that satisfies the equation or makes the equation true, and many equations can be simplified as part of the solution process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe89pkRKzRw#t=12.036s
Solving One Step Equations:  A Summary	LET'S BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT THE SOLUTION OF AN EQUATION. ANY REPLACEMENT FOR THE VARIABLE THAT MAKES AN EQUATION TRUE IS CALLED A SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE, X = 3 IS A SOLUTION TO THE EQUATION 5X - 4 = 11.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1AdhLbmLU8#t=13.09s
Ex: Solve a One Step Equation by Adding or Subtracting a Fraction (x+a/b = c/d Pos Answer)	We want to find the solution to the equation x minus 3/2 equals 1/8. The solution is the value of x that makes the difference on the left equal to 1/8. In order to solve the equation for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation, and because the x is on the left side of the equation, our solution will be in the form of x equals some number, again, where this number minus 3/2 equals 1/8.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1fbLD4oUPU#t=0.853s
Ex: Solve a One Step Equation With Decimals (Add/Subtract)	The solution is the value of x that makes the sum on the left equal to seven, point, three, eight. In order to solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation, and because x is on the left side, our solution will be in the form of x equals some value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEH-LAjWQes#t=15.62s

Ex:  Solve Proportions (Advanced)	We want to solve each proportion. A proportion is formed when we have two rates or ratios equal to each other. And for all proportions, the cross products are equal. So if we have a proportion in this form here, then a times d will always equal b times c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ztntKevuas#t=0.74s
Introduction to Solving Proportions	A proportion is an equation in the form of a over b equals c over d, where b and d are not equal to zero. There are two common ways to solve a proportion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIP1lbdjjtk#t=0.26s
Ex: Solve a Proportion or Equation in the Form x/a=b	Welcome to two examples on how to solve for proportion. A proportion is formed when we set two ratios or fractions equal to each other. So looking at the two equations below, notice how they're not in the form of most proportions because we have a whole number on one side of the equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCR_4Oaiuyc#t=0.404s
Ex: Solve a Proportion by Clearing Fractions (a/x=b/c, Whole Num Solution)	Welcome to two examples of solving a proportion, a proportion is formed when we set two fractions or ratios equal to each other. Notice how in these two proportions, there's one unknown value represented by the variable x, and there are several methods that we can use to solve a proportion, but for these two examples, we'll be using the method of clearing the fractions from the equations in order to solve the proportions, and clearing fractions is a common method for solving equations that contain fractions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZSZG_zpuM#t=0.723s
Ex: Solve a Proportion by Clearing Fractions ((a/x=b/c, Fraction Solution)	Again, let's convert this to a mixed number. 54/5 means 54 divided by five. And there's one five in five, subtract, bring down the next digit. There are zero fives in four, so we have zero, zero times five is zero, subtract again, we have a remainder of four, which means the quotient is 10 4/5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrgLddU8pFU#t=246.573s
Examples:  Applications Using Proportions	So x is 213 and 1/3 miles, which would be the distance between the two cities that are 4 inches apart on the map. Let's take a look at one more. An ice cream label states that one 6 ounce serving has 8 grams of fat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnB1mh5X5cA#t=203.116s
Unit Scale	Unit scale is a ratio that compares the dimensions of a scaled object to the actual dimensions of an object. So for example if we read a map, and the legend states that one fourth of an inch is equal to five miles, this is a unit scale.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHqF4zHBGkU#t=14.639s
Solving Proportions (L6.2)	Welcome to a lesson on proportions. Let's begin with some definitions. First, a ratio is the quotient of two quantities with the same unit of measure. For example, a ratio in a recipe might be six cups of flour to two cups of sugar.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFWipXB2WHg#t=0.782s
Solving Proportions (L6.2)	So six to two simplifies to three to one. Next, a rate is the quotient of two quantities with different units of measure. For example, let's say you go on a trip and travel 300 miles in four hours.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFWipXB2WHg#t=39.045s
Solving Proportions (L6.2)	And then finally, a proportion is a mathematical statement that two ratios or rates are equal. So proportion is always in this form here. An important property about proportions is that the cross products are always equal, meaning A times D is always equal to B times C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFWipXB2WHg#t=69.66s
Proportions - Intro, Cross Product, and Applications	Welcome to a lesson on proportions. A proportion is formed by setting two equivalent rates, or ratios equal to each other. Looking toward the bottom of the screen, because the ratio of two to three is equivalent to the ratio of four to six, this is a proportion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wzu7Ik-AAA#t=0.0s
Scale Factor	Scale factor is a ratio comparing the scaled measurement to the actual measurement. So for example, if we take a look at these triangles here. If the original or actual triangle was the one in the middle, and let's say we had a scale factor of two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC4aTrXNFJQ#t=15.7s
Write Equivalent Numerical Expressions	In this video, we will look at four examples of creating equivalent numerical expressions. Numerical expressions that have the same numerical value are called equivalent numerical expressions. In the first problem, we're asked to write an expression equivalent to the expression below using subtraction at least once.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mq8wSa1rgc#t=0.15s
Ex 1: Simplify an Expression in Fraction form (Order of Operations)	Which means when we have an expression in fraction form we treat the expression as if there are parentheses or grouping symbols around the numerator and denominator. Which means when we have an expression in fraction form we simplify the numerator and denominator separately and then the last step we simply the fraction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK7-w77cgVQ#t=12.774s
Ex:  Evaluate Exponential Expression	>> We want to expand and multiply each of these exponential expressions. When we have an expression written in exponential form we have a base and an exponent. The exponent is the smaller number that is slightly raised on the right, See here we have an exponent of 2, here we have an exponent of 3, and here we have an exponent of 5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGb3uAIk_mw#t=0.716s
Ex:  Evaluate Exponential Expression	The larger number to the left is called the base, so here the base is 5, here the base is 4, and here the base is 3. So when something is written in exponential form the exponent tells us how many factors of the base we're multiplying together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGb3uAIk_mw#t=21.696s
Multiplying and Dividing Involving Zero	Next, the commutative property states that when two numbers are being multiplied together, the product is the same regardless of the order. So three times five, or five times three is equal to fifteen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcVnwjBgDmk#t=26.46s
Signed Number Operations (L1.4)	So the absolute value of negative three is three. Next we have the absolute value of positive three, which is the distance three is from zero, which would be this distance here, which notice the distance from three to zero is also one, two, three units.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw7CUBX8DU4#t=72.809s
Multiplying Integers Using Integer Chips (Opposites)	The product of two integers with the same sign is positive, meaning a positive times a positive is equal to positive, and a negative times a negative is also equal to a positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVwbaEPedys#t=225.17s
Discover the Rules of Multiplying Integers Using Opposites and The Commutative Property	Opposites are two numbers that have a sum of zero. Since four plus negative four equals zero, four and negative four are opposites. It's also true that if we plot opposites on the number line, for example, four and negative four, they're on the opposite side of zero, but they are equidistant from zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOlo6LhHRXc#t=15.479s
Discover the Rules of Multiplying Integers Using Opposites and The Commutative Property	The commutative property of multiplication states that a times b equals b times a. So if we change the order of multiplication, it does not affect the product. So for example, we know that two times four equals eight, and so does four times two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOlo6LhHRXc#t=71.473s
Multiplying and Dividing Signed Numbers	First I want to talk about opposites. Five and negative five are called opposites. They're called opposites because their sum is equal to zero and they're also the same distance from zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRSse0xck3A#t=12.0s
Use the Percent Equation to Find a Percent	The amount is the part of the whole. The base is the whole amount. Let's begin by identifying these three parts. Again the question reads what percent of fifty-six is seven. So because it reads what percent, the percent is the unknown.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2KHHFMhJRs#t=14.639s
Use a Percent Equation to Solve for a Base or Whole Amount	And the whole amount is the unknown, which is called the base. Let's use the variable b to represent the base. Now we will write the percent equation. Percent is forty percent times the base, which is the unknown, so times b, equals the amount, which is sixty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3etjmUw8K3A#t=40.54s
Ex: Add Fractions with Unlike Denominators (With Model)	Looking our example, we have three-fifths, plus one-half, notice, how we not have a common denominator and therefore we cannot add these fractions, in their current form. if we're able to determine the smallest common denominator, it's called the least common denominator which should be the least common  multiple of five and two, which is also the smallest number that's divisible by five and two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWX4sP5mFJI#t=26.62s
Ex 3: Find the Sum of Two Fractions Using Pattern Blocks (Sum Greater Than 1)	Both answers are correct which is expressed in a different form. We say that one and a half is a mixed number, because it consists of a whole number and a fraction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gA7l-itLt4#t=141.98s
Determine the Sum of Fractions Using Formal Rules	And notice the result gives us a simplified fraction of five-fourths. So there is more than one way to simplify a fraction. We should also recognize that five-fourths indicates we have five copies of one- fourth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=496rjfeVbEU#t=199.92s
Determine the Sum of Fractions Using Formal Rules	The denominator of four indicates it takes four parts to make one whole. So because the numerator is greater than, or equal to four, this is called an improper fraction. Which means sometimes the sum will also be expressed as a mixed number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=496rjfeVbEU#t=218.8s
Determine the Sum of Fractions Using Formal Rules	Now that we have a common denominator we can add the fractions. Three plus four is equal to seven and the denominator remains six. Three-sixths plus four-sixths equals seven-sixths means we have three copies of one-sixth, and we're adding four copies of one-sixths, which equals seven copies of one-sixth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=496rjfeVbEU#t=398.02s
Ex: Subtract Fractions with Unlike Denominators (Build LCD with Primes)	So 15 times 21 would give us a common denominator, but because that's rather large, let's work on determining the smallest possible common denominator called the least common denominator. The least common denominator is the least common multiple of 15 and 21, which is also the smallest number that's divisible by both 15 and 21.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksay1jOnSoo#t=36.797s
Ex: Subtract Fractions with Unlike Denominators (With Model)	If we're able to determine the smallest possible common denominator, it's called the least common denominator, which is the least common multiple of three and four. It's also the smallest number divisible by both three and four.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhXSvwHcWtk#t=34.14s
Ex: Find the Sum of Two Mixed Numbers Using Pattern Blocks	Four and one-third is called a mixed number, because it contains a whole number and a proper fraction. And thirteen-thirds is called an improper fraction, because the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SngHXtqs_UE#t=163.98s
Ex: Subtract Fractions with Unlike Denominators (Basic with Model)	and therefore we cannot subtract the fractions in this form. If we were able to determine the  smallest possible common denominator, it's called the least common denominator, which is the least common multiple six and two, but is also the smallest number, divisible by both six and two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpHtOMjeI7g#t=34.31s
Determine the Difference of Fractions Using Formal Rules	The LCD is the least common multiple of the denominators. Step two: Write each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the LCD or common denominator. Three: add or subtract the fractions by adding or subtracting the numerators and keeping the common denominator the same.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTosdj60HAg#t=32.759s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (A)	Next we're comparing three- sevenths and three-halves. Three-sevenths means we have three copies of one-seventh, and three-halves means we have three copies of one-half. Notice how for both fractions we have the same number of copies, but because one-seventh is less than one-half, three-sevenths is less than three-halves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A73jndUIXzI#t=47.489s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (A)	Well having two copies of one- fifth is less than having four copies of one-fifth and therefore two-fifths is less than four-fifths. Next we're comparing five-sevenths and five-ninths. Five-sevenths means five copies of one-seventh and five-ninths means five copies of one-ninth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A73jndUIXzI#t=90.84s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (A)	So we have the same number of copies, but because one-seventh is greater than one-ninth, five-sevenths is greater than five-ninths. And then finally we're comparing four-eighths and one-half. The fraction four-eighths means we're referring to four parts, or it takes eight parts to make a whole.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A73jndUIXzI#t=113.36s
Subtracting Signed Fractions	So it's important to remember, when adding or subtracting fractions, we must have a common denominator. If we don't have the same or like denominators, then the first step is going to be to determine the least common multiple of the denominators, this is called the least common denominator, or LCD, and once we find the LCD, we're going to create equivalent fractions with this common denominator, and then we'll keep the denominator the same, and subtract the numerators, and simplify if possible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RflSCEcWLz0#t=60.565s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (B)	The numerator indicates how many parts are being considered. So the fraction one-fourth means we're considering one part where it takes four parts to make a whole. And the fraction one-half means we're considering one part where it takes two parts to make the whole. Which means one-fourth is less than one-half.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCtL85NVo8#t=12.1s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (B)	Next we're comparing three-sixths to itself and therefore three-sixths is equal to three-sixths. Next we have three-sevenths compared to three-halves. Three-sevenths means we're considering three parts where it takes seven parts to make the whole.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCtL85NVo8#t=32.2s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (B)	And three-halves means we're considering three parts, where it takes two parts to make the whole. So for both fractions were considering the same number of parts but for three-sevenths the parts are smaller and therefore three-sevenths is less than three-halves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCtL85NVo8#t=51.84s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (B)	Next we have two-fifths compared to four-fifths. Two-fifths means we're considering two parts where it takes five parts to make a whole, and four-fifths means we're considering four parts, where again it takes five parts to make a whole.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCtL85NVo8#t=65.28s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (B)	So for these two fractions the parts are the same size, but because for two-fifths we're considering less parts. Two-fifths is less than four-fifths. Next we have five-sevenths compared to five-ninths. Five-sevenths means we're considering five parts where it takes seven parts to make a whole.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCtL85NVo8#t=80.36s
Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerators Or Same Denominators - No LCD (B)	And for the last problem, we're comparing four-eighths to one-half. Four-eighths means we're considering four parts where it takes eight parts to make a whole. Because we're considering half the parts that make a whole, four-eighths equals one-half.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCtL85NVo8#t=118.01s
The Distributive Property with Negative Integers	In this lesson we will be discussing the distributive property of multiplication, often referred to as multiplication over addition or subtraction. We will also mainly be focusing on distributing negative integers. But for review, for multiplication over addition, the distributive property is defined as a time's the quantity B plus C equals a times B plus a times C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHk8bf4d7tE#t=0.03s
The Distributive Property with Negative Integers	For multiplication over subtraction, the distributive property is defined as A time's the quantity B minus C equals A times B minus a times C. We say we distribute the A, meaning A is multiplied by both B and C inside the parentheses and the operation of subtraction remains the same.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHk8bf4d7tE#t=48.329s
Evaluate Absolute Value Variable Expressions	The absolute value of a number is a number's distance from zero, and distance is always positive. Looking at the number line below, negative 51 is to the left of zero, and negative 51 is 51 units from zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAZ23MRH9UA#t=18.51s
Evaluating Algebraic Expressions	>> Welcome to a lesson on evaluating Algebraic expressions. An expression in which some or all of the terms contain variables is an algebraic expression or a variable expression. If the value of the variables is known we can evaluate the expression, so to evaluate an algebraic or variable expression we substitute the value of the variables into the expression and then evaluate using the order of operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR-PI9303TE#t=0.786s
Simplifying Algebraic Expressions	But sometimes when we try to simplify an expression inside parentheses, we can't because the terms are not like terms. The distributive property provides a way to eliminate the parentheses. So just to review, the distributive property states that that A times the quantity B plus or minus C is equal to AB plus or minus AC.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A8lLbZCrlw#t=19.726s
Circumference, Volume of a Cone, Pythagorean Theorem (L1.5)	In example one, we're told the circumference of a circle with radius r is given by the formula C equals 2 pi r.

Ex: Write a Algebraic Expression in the Form (x+a)+(x-b) and ax(bx+c)	The first thing to recognize here is that we have a sum, which means we'll be adding. The two things we add are called add-ins, so for this statement the first add-in is a number increased by three and the second add-in is the number decreased by 20.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDxVkqB9qzg#t=17.222s
Ex: Write a Algebraic Expression in the Form (x+a)+(x-b) and ax(bx+c)	The first thing to recognize for this statement is that product means multiplication. When multiplying, the two things we multiple are called factors so for this statement the first factor is twice a number, and the second factor is seven more than five time the number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDxVkqB9qzg#t=89.05s
Fraction Application - Surface Area and Weight of a Tank	We also need to find the radius, which is the length of the segment from the center of the circle to the edge of the circle, which is half of the diameter, so we can say R for radius is equal to 1/2 times the diameter of 7/3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9v5z0L5J1U#t=73.625s

Complex Fraction Application - Total Resistance of a Parallel Circuit	Now, to simplify this, we'll first have to add the fractions here in the denominator by obtaining a common denominator. And, let's do this on the next slide. The least common denominator is going to be the least common multiple of 15 and 20, or the smallest number that's divisible by both 15 and 20.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPmaYC6FYAc#t=84.115s
Perimeter and Area Formulas	A polygon is a closed geometric figure with three or more sides. The perimeter of any polygon is the distance around it or the sum of the lengths of its sides, so really when it comes to perimeter you don't have to memorize any formula, find the perimeter of a polygon you can't just find the sum of the lengths of all sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZASBmoylCPc#t=14.276s

Introduction to Metric Conversions	If we move it right three places, one, two, three fill in the missing digits with zeros. Notice how we do get four million, two hundred thousand, which is the number of milligrams in four thousand, two hundred grams.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u1KLltlYoE#t=212.12s
Metric Unit Conversion	And 1 gram is the mass a cubic centimeter of water, there is often confusion between mass and weight. Mass is the measurement of the amount of matter something contains. While weight is the measurement of the pull of gravity of an object.  So as a result the mass of an object doesn't change.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMFwpxkIFMY#t=55.5s
Common Metric Weight Conversions Using Unit Fractions	Because the conversion is one kilogram equals 1,000 grams, the unit fraction is 1,000 grams over one kilogram. Notice kilograms simplify out, and now we have grams. But we want milligrams, which means, for the second unit fraction, because we have grams in the numerator, in order for grams to simplify out, we need grams in the denominator of the second unit fraction and milligrams in the numerator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R10voA9BEo#t=213.48s
Ex:  Find the Median of a Data Set	>> We want to determine the median of the given sale prices. The median is the number in the middle when the data is ordered from least to greatest.

Mean, Median, and Mode	- WELCOME TO A LESSON  ON HOW TO DETERMINE THE MEAN, MEDIAN AND MODE  OF A SET OF DATA. A STATISTIC IS A NUMBER  THAT DESCRIBES A SET OF DATA.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQAod4-az8#t=0.8s
Mean, Median, and Mode	SO TO DETERMINE THE MEAN, WE JUST ADD ALL OF THE NUMBERS AND THEN DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER  OF NUMBERS. THE MEDIAN IS THE NUMBER  IN THE MIDDLE WHEN THE DATA IS ORDERED  FROM LEAST TO GREATEST.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQAod4-az8#t=24.933s
Mean, Median, and Mode	THAT ALSO TELLS US THAT HALF  OF THE VALUES ARE ABOVE 88 OR 50% OF THE VALUES  ARE ABOVE 88, AND 50% OF THE VALUES  ARE BELOW 88. AND THEN LASTLY, THE MODE IS THE NUMBER OR NUMBERS  THAT OCCUR THE MOST OFTEN.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQAod4-az8#t=165.747s
Mean, Median, and Mode	AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS  WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE STATISTIC  TO DESCRIBE A SET OF DATA. THE VALUES THAT ARE REALLY LARGE  OR REALLY SMALL FROM MOST OF THE OTHER VALUES ARE SOMETIMES CALLED OUTLIERS, AND THEY CAN HAVE  A MUCH LARGER IMPACT ON THE MEAN THAN THEY DO THE MEDIAN.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQAod4-az8#t=393.273s
Determine the Mean, Median, Mode, and Range of a Data Set	Close parenthesis, and then divided by 10, which gives us 99.3 for the mean. Next we're asked to find the median. The median of a data set is evaluating the middle when the data is in order from least to greatest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFqiHwavYh4#t=66.07s
Determine the Mean, Median, Mode, and Range of a Data Set	When we have an even number of data values, we have to find the mean of the two middle values. Next we have the mode. The mode is the element or value of the data set that occurs most frequently, and notice 119 occurs three times which is the most any data value occurs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFqiHwavYh4#t=146.56s
Determine the Mean, Median, Mode, and Range of a Data Set	The mode is 119. And then finally we are asked to find the range. The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the data set, which in our case the maximum value is 119, the minimum value is 73, the range is equal to 119 minus 73, which is 46.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFqiHwavYh4#t=168.36s
Ex: Find the Mean and Median of a Data Set Given in a Frequency Table (odd)	The second column gives the frequency of each test score. We want to determined the mean score as well as the median score. So for review let's start with the mean. The mean of a set of data is the sum of the data values divided by the number of data values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEm5x1iQrwE#t=9.76s
Ex: Find the Mean and Median of a Data Set Given in a Frequency Table (even)	So the one decimal place the means approximately six point four. And now let's find the median score. For review the median of a set of data is the value in the middle when the date is in order from least to greatest.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rBbOrvrNOQ#t=184.5s

Factors	Welcome to a lesson on factors. The goals of this video are to determine the factors of a natural number, and also to define prime and composite numbers. First, the natural numbers, often called the counting numbers, is the set of numbers that we see listed here, one, two, three, four, five, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9dsxTCjdhE#t=0.575s
Factors	Factors are the numbers that divide evenly into a given number. This means a factor divides into another number and there is no remainder. So for example, if we let N be a natural number, and X times Y is equal to N, then X and Y are both factors of the number N.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9dsxTCjdhE#t=18.94s
Factors	A prime number is a natural number, greater than one, that has only two factors: one and itself. And here's a list of the first several prime numbers. And of course, now we can add 23 to this list, because we just found that 23 only had two factors as well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9dsxTCjdhE#t=272.861s
Factors	All of the other examples were what's called a composite number. A composite number is a natural number that has more than two factors. So going back to our examples, this is the only number here that had two factors, 120, 54, and 24 all had more than two factors, and therefore, are called composite numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9dsxTCjdhE#t=293.159s
Determine Multiples of a Given Number	We're asked to list the first four multiples of six. A multiple of a number is the product of the number and a counting number. Counting numbers are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on which means the first multiple of 6 is 6 times 1 which equals 6.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkEWqspRVKk#t=0.0s
Ex 1: Determine the GCF and LCM using Prime Factors and a Venn Diagram	The least common multiple or LCM is the least number that is a multiple of two numbers. It's also the smallest number that is divisible by the two numbers. So if we were to combine all these factors or take the union of these two sets this would give us the least common multiple.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is84_n3HlN8#t=186.06s
Solving One Step Equations Using Multiplication and Division (Basic)	The solution is the value of  x that satisfies the equation or makes the equation true. In order to solve, we need to isolate the variable on one side the equation. Looking at the left side,  we have one-third x which means one third times x so we're probably thinking and we should divide both sides of the equation by one-third which is true, but remember instead of dividing by a fraction we normally multiplied by the reciprocal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN7iVWWl2y0#t=105.31s
Solve One-Step Equations Using Addition and Subtraction  (Whole Numbers)	Well the opposite operation of minus nine is plus nine and therefore to isolate x and solve the equation we add 9 to both sides of the equation. More formally, reason we can add nine to both sides of the equation is due to the addition property of equality, which states that if two expressions are equal to each other and you add the same value to both sides of the equation, the equation will remain equal or remain true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsWrFKFerSY#t=37.96s
Solving One Step Equations Using Addition and Subtraction (Integers)	Now let's look at the second equation which is x minus 24 equals negative 59. The solution is the value of x that satisfies the equation or makes the equation true. In order to solve the equation, we isolate the variable on one side of the equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3T8eCT5U_w#t=107.09s
Solving One Step Equations:  The Basic	LET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT WHAT A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION IS. ANY VALUE FOR A VARIABLE THAT MAKES AN EQUATION TRUE IS CALLED A SOLUTION TO THE EQUATION. FOR EXAMPLE, X = 8 IS A SOLUTION TO THE EQUATION X - 3 = 5 BECAUSE IF WE REPLACE OR SUBSTITUTE 8 FOR X, WE WOULD HAVE 8 - 3 = 5 WHICH IS TRUE.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T-_K_-VSJE#t=12.18s
Solving One Step Equations:  The Basic	"THE ADDITION PRINCIPLE STATES THAT IF WE HAVE ""A"" = B AND THEN WE ADD THE SAME VALUE TO BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION, THE EQUATION WILL STILL BE TRUE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT 5 IS EQUAL TO 5."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T-_K_-VSJE#t=46.78s
Solving One-Step Equations (L5.2)	Welcome to a lesson on solving one-step equations. To solve an equation means to undo all the operations of the equation leaving the variable by itself on one side. This is known as isolating the variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DetbpqoXy8#t=0.0s
Solving One-Step Equations (L5.2)	In example five we have negative three y equals negative 42. Negative three y means negative three times y so to isolate y on the left side of the equation we want to undo this multiplication the opposite operation of multiplication is division so in this equation to isolate y we would divide both sides by negative three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DetbpqoXy8#t=383.127s

(0.3) Lesson: Classifying Differential Equations	Let's begin with the distinction between ordinary and partial differential equations. Ordinary differential equations, or ODEs, are equations where the derivatives are taken with respect to only one variable. That is there's only one independent variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChCLGHAqCm0#t=11.4s
(0.3) Lesson: Classifying Differential Equations	Partial differential equations, or PDEs, are equations that depend on partial derivatives of several variables. That is, there are several independent variables. And again, below we have three examples. We have the transport equation, the heat equation and the wave equation in two dimensions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChCLGHAqCm0#t=40.47s
(0.3) Lesson: Classifying Differential Equations	In particular, we say an equation is linear if the dependent variable or variables and their derivatives appear linearly. That is, only as first powers. They're not multiplied together and no other functions of the dependent variables appear.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChCLGHAqCm0#t=168.12s

(0.3) Lesson: Classifying Differential Equations	A linear equation may further be called homogeneous if all terms depend on the dependent variable. That is, if no term is a function of the independent variables alone. Otherwise, the equation is called nonhomogeneous or nonhomogenous, or inhomogeneous, or inhomogeneous.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChCLGHAqCm0#t=301.941s
(0.3) Lesson: Classifying Differential Equations	The coefficients are the functions multiplying the dependent variable, or one of it's derivatives, not the function B of X standing alone.

(0.3) Lesson: Classifying Differential Equations	And then finally, an equation or system is called autonomous if the equation does not depend on the independent variable. For autonomous ordinary differential equations, the independent variable is then thought of as time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChCLGHAqCm0#t=460.98s

Evaluate Absolute Value Variable Expressions	The absolute value of a number is a number's distance from zero, and distance is always positive. Looking at the number line below, negative 51 is to the left of zero, and negative 51 is 51 units from zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAZ23MRH9UA#t=18.51s
Algebraic Expression Vocabulary (L2.2)	The constant term is a term or number with no variable factors, a term whose value never changes. So for example one, we're given the algebraic expression four x to the fifth plus three x to the fourth minus 22 x squared minus x plus 17.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6lK-by__rA#t=23.623s
Algebraic Expression Vocabulary (L2.2)	That's the term with no variable factors, if you can see, is this last term here, positive 17. Now let's define factors and coefficient. Factors are numbers or variables that are multiplied together, and a coefficient is a number that multiplies the variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6lK-by__rA#t=109.781s
Evaluating Algebraic Expressions	>> Welcome to a lesson on evaluating Algebraic expressions. An expression in which some or all of the terms contain variables is an algebraic expression or a variable expression. If the value of the variables is known we can evaluate the expression, so to evaluate an algebraic or variable expression we substitute the value of the variables into the expression and then evaluate using the order of operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR-PI9303TE#t=0.786s
Simplifying Algebraic Expressions	But sometimes when we try to simplify an expression inside parentheses, we can't because the terms are not like terms. The distributive property provides a way to eliminate the parentheses. So just to review, the distributive property states that that A times the quantity B plus or minus C is equal to AB plus or minus AC.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A8lLbZCrlw#t=19.726s
Combining Like Terms	Now let's take a look at how we're going to be combining like terms. The distributive law enables us to combine or collect like terms. The distributive law states for any numbers a, b, c, a times the quantity b plus or minus c is equal to a b plus or minus a c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C72lpuGQYo4#t=88.879s
Convert a Percent to a Ratio or Fraction (88% and 75%)	And therefore a percent is a ratio or fraction whose denominator is 100. And we use the percent symbol to show percent. So number 1, we are given 88 percent which means 88 per 100 or 88 out of one hundred.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3cmil-uZc0#t=12.09s
Convert Large and Small Percent to a Decimal and Fraction	We can define a percent as a ratio with a denominator of 100. Notice 20% equals the fraction 20/100 or the ratio of 20 to 100. Going back to our first example, we're asked to convert 486% to a decimal and a fraction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOxxP8dIF6c#t=16.37s
Represent a Percent or Decimal Using 10 by 10 Grids	Now that we know three-twentieths is equal to fifteen-hundredths, we know three-twentieths is equal to fifteen percent. Let's look at two more examples. Here we're given the fraction five-fourths. Five-fourths means five copies of one-fourth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfIsofMkzLw#t=195.8s
Represent a Percent or Decimal Using 10 by 10 Grids	A percent is the number compared to one hundred and therefore, one hundred fifty percent is equal to one hundred fifty hundredths. If we take a look at the model when we divide this unit into two equal parts, each part is equal to one-half and we have one, two, three copies of one-half, which equals three-halves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfIsofMkzLw#t=319.46s
Convert Ratios to Percents and Simplfied Fractions (35 to 100 and 48 to 50)	We write them in fraction form. And now looking at the notes below, the two words per cent means per 100 and therefor a percent is a ratio or fraction whose denominator is 100 and we use the percent symbol, a %, to show percent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA_jYlwVi1U#t=38.143s
Example 2:  Relating Fractions, Decimals, and Percents	SO, AS I SAID A MOMENT AGO, A PERCENTAGE IS A NUMBER  COMPARED TO 100. SO WRITTEN AS A FRACTION  THIS WOULD BE 0.4/100. BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE OUR FRACTION  IN THIS FORM BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE  A DECIMAL INSIDE A FRACTION.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SphqHJVVMak#t=130.513s
Use a Shaded 10 by 10 Grid to Write a Ratio, Decimal, and Percent	A percent is a number compared to one hundred. Eighty-five hundredths is equal to eighty-five percent. Before we go to the next example though, I do want to mention we can simplify ratios just like we simplify fractions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb3PzQwwToI#t=105.959s
Convert Percentages to Decimals - Two Methods	The second method is a shortcut method in which we begin with the percentage, move the decimal point two places to the left and remove the percent sign. In this exercise, we will show both methods for the first three percentages and then for the last two percentages, we will only use the shortcut.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgEJEkGnPfQ#t=24.793s
Percent Intro and Basic Percent, Fraction, Decimal Conversions (No Calculator)	Welcome to Introduction to Percentages. The word percent or percentage means parts per 100 and we use the percent sign, this sign here, to denote a percent or percentage. For example, if there is a 10% chance it will rain today, we use this notation here for 10%, which means there are 10 chances out of a total 100 chances that it will rain today, and therefore, we can also express 10% as a fraction as 10/100, which simplifies to the fraction 1/10, or as a decimal 0.1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t8gRZnPOIg#t=0.633s
Use the Commutative and  Associate Properties of Real Numbers	The Associative Property of Addition is the quantity a plus b plus c equals a times the quantity b plus c. The Associative Property of Addition involves changing the grouping in a sum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOcMDyJA7Yw#t=120.266s
Identify Addition Properties of Real Numbers	Next we have the associative property of addition, which is given as the quantity a plus b plus c equals a plus the quantity b plus c. When we change the grouping symbols or parentheses within a sum, we are using the associative property of addition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKgRqHEjbRI#t=28.191s
Identify Addition Properties of Real Numbers	Next we have the identity property of addition, which is given as a plus zero equals a, or zero plus a equals a, where zero is called the additive identity. And then finally we have the inverse property of addition, which is given as a plus negative a equals zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKgRqHEjbRI#t=44.932s
Identify Addition Properties of Real Numbers	When adding opposites, the sum is always zero, and this is the inverse property of addition. We can say that negative a, or the opposite of a, is called the additive inverse of a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKgRqHEjbRI#t=62.268s
Real Numbers	"A SET IS A COLLECTION OF OBJECTS. THE SET CONTAINING ""A,"" B AND C IS USUALLY WRITTEN WITH BRACES, ""A"" COMMA, B COMMA, C. THE SET OF REAL NUMBERS IS MADE UP OF ALL RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL NUMBERS, WHICH WE'LL DEFINE SHORTLY."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py-iSJziA_8#t=13.39s
Real Numbers	YOU CAN THINK OF THE SET OF REAL NUMBERS AS ANY NUMBER THAT WOULD APPEAR ON THE NUMBER LINE. SO THE REAL NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBERS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN IN DECIMAL NOTATION, INCLUDING THOSE THAT REQUIRE AN INFINITE DECIMAL EXPANSION.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py-iSJziA_8#t=30.09s
Real Numbers	SO, AGAIN, REAL NUMBERS ARE THE SET OF NUMBERS CORRESPONDING TO ANY POINT ON THE NUMBER LINE. HERE IS A VARIETY OF EXAMPLES. ALL REAL NUMBERS ARE EITHER RATIONAL OR IRRATIONAL NUMBERS.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py-iSJziA_8#t=62.21s
Real Numbers	"THE DEFINITION OF AN IRRATIONAL NUMBER IS THE SET OF ALL NUMBERS, ""A"" DIVIDED BY B WHERE ""A"" AND B ARE INTEGERS. BUT IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO THINK OF A RATIONAL NUMBER AS A NUMBER THAT IN DECIMAL FORM, IT EITHER TERMINATES OR REPEATS WITH A PATTERN."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py-iSJziA_8#t=74.66s
Determine the Additive Inverses	We're asked to determine the additive inverse of negative 12. The additive inverse of negative 12 is the number we add to negative 12 so that the sum is zero. And since negative 12 plus positive 12 is equal to zero, the additive inverse of negative 12 is positive 12.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx2lxsy0DPg#t=0.7s
Determine Expressions that are NOT Real	Rational numbers are the set of numbers that can be written in the form of a divided by b where a and b are integers and b can't be zero. b can't be zero because division by zero is undefined.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_74opAgq0nc#t=12.28s
Determine  Rational or Irrational Numbers (Square Roots and Decimals Only)	We are asked to identify each of the following numbers as rational or irrational. Let's begin by defining real numbers. Real numbers are numbers that would appear on the number line, and all real numbers are rational or irrational.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lYbSxSBu0Y#t=1.867s
Determine  Rational or Irrational Numbers (Square Roots and Decimals Only)	Rational numbers are numbers that can be written in the form of a over b with a and b as integers, b not equal to zero. In decimal form, rational numbers terminate or repeat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lYbSxSBu0Y#t=16.17s
Determine  Rational or Irrational Numbers (Square Roots and Decimals Only)	On the other hand, irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written in the form of a over b, with a and b as integers. In decimal form, irrational numbers do not terminate and do not repeat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lYbSxSBu0Y#t=29.731s
Identify the Commutative, Associate, and Distributive Properties of Real Numbers	Simplifying further, 6*4= 24 and so does 2*12. Next we have the distributive property, which is given as a[b+c]=a*b+a*c. In this property, we distribute the a and we have a*b+a*c. This is often referred to as multiplication across addition.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Klf5fLMGVo#t=145.697s
Determine the Multiplicative Inverse	We're asked to determine the multiplicative inverse of negative 12. The multiplicative inverse of negative 12 is the number we multiply negative 12 by so that the product is positive one. So if we write negative 12 as a fraction with a denominator of one, we would have negative 12 over positive one times, and now if we multiply by the reciprocal, the product will be positive one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqmPvAX0u1I#t=0.48s
Properties of Real Numbers	The commutative property of addition is when we change the order of a sum which states a plus b equals b plus a. The community property multiplication is when we change the order of multiplication, which dates a times b equals b times a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=17.19s
Properties of Real Numbers	Next we have the associative property which deals with grouping. The associative property of addition states a times the quantity b plus c equals the quantity a + b + c. When we change the grouping of a sum we are using the associative property.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=29.429s
Properties of Real Numbers	The associative property of multiplication states a times b c equals a b times c. When we change the grouping of multiplication, we are using the associative property. Next is the distributive property which states a times the quantity b plus c equals a times b plus a times c.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=45.21s
Properties of Real Numbers	The distributive property is often referred to as multiplication across addition. Next is the identity property of addition and of multiplication. The identity property of addition states there exists a unique real number called the additive identity, 0, such that for any real number a + 0 equals a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=69.51s
Properties of Real Numbers	The identity property of multiplication states there exists a unique real number called the multiplicative identity, one, such that for any real number a, a times 1 equals a. And then finally we have the inverse property of addition and the inverse property of multiplication.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=89.159s
Properties of Real Numbers	The inverse property of addition states every real number a has an additive inverse or opposite denoted negative a of the opposite of a such that a plus negative a equals 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=107.79s
Properties of Real Numbers	The inverse property of multiplication states every nonzero real number, a, has a multiplicative inverse or reciprocal denoted one over a such that a times 1 over a equals 1. So going back to our example, looking at expression one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFm8Os_4C8#t=116.85s
Identifying Sets of Real Numbers	THEN WE'LL WORK OUR WAY UP. SO, NATURAL NUMBERS ARE COUNTING NUMBERS IDENTIFIED BY CAPITAL N OF THE NUMBERS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, AND SO ON. SO, LOOKING AT OUR VENN DIAGRAM HERE, THE NATURAL NUMBERS WOULD BE THESE NUMBERS IN THIS SET HERE, AGAIN, IDENTIFIED BY CAPITAL N.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htP2goe31MM#t=22.57s
Identifying Sets of Real Numbers	AND THEN IRRATIONAL NUMBERS ARE NUMBERS THAT, IN DECIMAL FORM, DO NOT TERMINATE AND DO NOT REPEAT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, SQUARE ROOT 5 WOULD BE SOME NON-TERMINATING, NON-REPEATING DECIMAL, AND OF COURSE, SO IS PI.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htP2goe31MM#t=143.51s
Identify Multiplication Properties of Real Numbers	And then finally we have seven times 1/7 equals 1. Whenever we have a product equal to one, we are using the inverse property of multiplication, which is d, where seven and 1/7 are reciprocals of one another, or we can say 1/7 is the multiplicative inverse of seven.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDjgAIws938#t=149.451s
Networks: Part 5 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So just a reminder on what we've  been doing last week or last week, we've been interested in the  problem of community detection and community detection is a problem where  you try to cluster the nodes of a graph, you try to find groups of nodes that  are densely connected with each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9ImBpxlG8#t=34.24s
Networks: Part 5 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Now, this is a very simple dynamics, and this is a fairly intuitive one, right, where you try always to reach consensus  with the states of your neighbours. Now we see this sort of differential  equations needs to be complemented with a certain initial condition,  x_0, which is the vector X when time is equal to zero. So  we have some initial conditions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9ImBpxlG8#t=574.72s
Networks: Part 5 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So it's going to be obtained by the vector of  one's transpose times in x_0, divided by N, which is simply equal to a sum  over the i's of x_0 at index i, divided by N. So you do just do an average, an  arithmetic average of all of your initial states, and that will give you the final  state that is reached by all of them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9ImBpxlG8#t=638.08s
Networks: Part 5 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	It means that many of its properties can be  derived from standard properties of Markov chains. One thing that is of interest is that if  the graph is undirected, as we consider, if it is connected, and if it is not bipartite, non-bipartite, and if you remember a bipartite graph is a graph where you can divide your graph in two sets and  all of the connexions are between the sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9ImBpxlG8#t=1021.84s
Networks: Part 5 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And these local equilibria would be concentrated  on nodes that belong to communities, communities that are associated to the  structure of the network. Thank you. So hello, everyone, and welcome for this  third video of the week for week five.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9ImBpxlG8#t=2357.52s
Networks: Part 5 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	What is L^pi? L^pi is. A k times k laplacian, where k is the number of  cells right? of an object called quotient graph. This means that we'll be  constructing a quotient graph that's gonna be your simplified version  of the graph, it is going to be smaller.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9ImBpxlG8#t=2850.16s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So if you remember last week we've  been looking at the interrelations that exist between some linear processes and  structures that are present in graphs. And we've been mainly focussing  on consensus dynamics, that was this model in which you would have that nodes try to adapt their state  to the state of their neighbours, which we've also shortly mentioned  discrete time random walks.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=30.32s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	An absorbing state is a state such that T ii is equal to one. Which means that  it's a node that is such that all of the flow goes back from the node to that very same node. And equivalently it  means that T ij is going to be equal to zero when i is different from j. So  it means here that there is no possibility for the probability to escape  that node, hence the name absorbing state.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=401.84s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And an example of such an absorbing state here  would be this node. Which is indeed absorbing. So another important concept is the concept of  ergodic set. So an ergodic set is a set of nodes Set of states such that you can go from any you state i to j, And from any j to i, yes, but also you do not escape the ergodic set. So once you're in the ergodic set you're going  to be staying there forever.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=428.88s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So clearly in this example, we  just had one transient node, that nodes that is such that after some time we can be sure that it will not be  visited anymore by any any any walker.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=570.0s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	well, jumps to one of its  out-neighbours. Because indeed when you have directed networks, you need  to differentiate between in-neighbours, those from the incoming links,  from the out-neighbours, those that are associated to the outgoing links.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=2138.16s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Now how do you define this page rank. Right. So page rank is going to be  defined as the stationary density of the random walk. And actually by definition it  means that it's going to be it's going to be a certain  vector P I star such that we have that this here, well P J, it's going  to be equal to a sum over the Js, uh sorry, a sum over the  Is, excuse me, of P I star and then we'll have A ij, divided by K i out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=2231.52s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	This is going to be good. But you just  need to be careful that those neighbours, have a degree, a node degree that is too large, that will not contribute much because  basically each of them has a certain a certain total importance that they can  share to their out-neighbours.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=2374.08s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So this is a dangling node, a node that  has incoming links with no outgoing ones. A dangling node. Well, when  you have dangling nodes, the usual procedure is then to say that we force teleportation when the walker is at a dangling node. So it means that  if you are not on the dangling node, you have a certain probability  to walk, another one to teleport, if you if you are that a dangling node, you always teleport, basically, it means  that there will always be a teleportation in that case. Now. Well, here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=3443.36s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	What we're going to be doing in this short  video is to consider one possible application of the use of random walks in order to  uncover some unknown properties in graphs. Now, there are many situations in statistics  where you would have a population, population of individuals that  would be a certain population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=3569.04s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So not two coupons like in the  previous example, but just one. Let's assume further that the  sampling can be done with replacement. Is with replacement. Which basically  means that a person can be contacted more than once, can participate  more than once in the experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=3890.32s
Networks: Part 6 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And one such model would be a non-backtracking random walk, that is a non-backtracking random  walk, that would be a random walk process, that would be such that, let's assume  that, I'll start from this node I go here. In a non-backtracking random  walk, I cannot go back where I came from.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctHyGe5D_k#t=4463.52s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And that's a quality function was defined as the fraction of edges that are within the communities that we compared with the expected fraction of such edges in an appropriate null model.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=83.84s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And we arrived at this expression that was this Newman-Girvan modularity that is a quality function, that is an objective function that you can try to optimise in order to find what would be the best partition of a graph and hence allowing you to find the best groups inside the graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=111.43s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And the idea of the map equation is to try to exploit those correlations by proposing some sort of a two layered generalisation of the Huffman code, and the idea, as we'll see, is going to be to have a Huffman code dictionary, a Huffman code inside each of the communities that is going to be used.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=1078.5s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And then to the node one zero. And then I use the code zero zero to say that I exit the community. And after that I will go into the community. One zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=1202.789s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	We'll be doing it as follows. So we assume that the dynamics has a certain equilibrium state and we start at this equilibrium state. We say that the quality of a partition is going to be equal, is going to be equal to sum of all of the communities of the probability to start inside the community at equilibrium and to be in the same community.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=1531.809s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	But now this is as such something that is already interesting. It means that instead of defining modularity as in terms of counting edges that are inside communities here, we don't think in terms of counting edges, we are actually interested in flows, how the flows remain encapsulated inside clusters in one time step for a random walk process.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=1764.859s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And there would be two directions to explore. First of all, let's look at what's happening in the case of directed networks, well in the case of directed networks. We have a game, a random walk process. Here we need to divide by kj out, the degree.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=1814.889s
Networks: Part 7 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	It's actually what was kind of interesting to note is that's actually stability at time one can be seen to be the modularity of another matrix. What would be that other matrix? It would be obtained from the symmetrised version that the symmetrization, the symmetrization of a matrix of the flows of probability between two nodes at stationarity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=---gzhcMEHA#t=2186.28s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Elections! In elections you have people debating  with each other, discussing with each other. And the combination of all of these interactions  leads to the formation of collective opinions. And in this case, to the election of one person  to be the president of the United States.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=169.92s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	You can think of collaboration networks, the  way scientists collaborate with each other. I can think of communication networks to each  of us, communicate by e-mail or by phone. I can think of online social networks, Facebook,  Twitter and same for biological networks.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=274.56s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And the fact that the boys play with the boys and  the girls play with the girls. On the bottom left, you have a functional network of the brain  and at bottom right you have a Food web, where, as I say, species are interacting with  each other, typically in a very hierarchical way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=438.08s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	All of the links are  organised completely randomly. But then they have a parameter that  allows them to interpolate between these two extremes and to define  what they call small-world networks, networks that would have a  balance between local order and randomness and this randomness  creating shortcuts in the system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=670.08s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	You have a graph and you try to cluster the notes  together by looking for dense groups of nodes, nodes that are very cohesively  connected with each other. And basically what you try to do  is to have a graph and to extract these groups in an algorithmic way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=840.72s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	We'll look at the problem of community detection, finding groups of nodes  that are densely connected. And finally, we try to identify certain structural  properties that are associated to an impact on- on the dynamics and in particular, well, for  the spreading of information and of a virus, for instance, on the graph. So those  people will those will be the kind of questions that we'll have in  mind in the next eight weeks.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=974.24s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So in this video, we'll be looking at Poisson processes that are a typical  example of a renewal process. So what is a Poisson process? Well,  typically Poisson processes are used as a very simple first  order model. To represent systems we would have a sequence, a random  sequence of events that take place in time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=1223.76s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Because the q goes to zero, it's  impossible in a very time of- very small time window to have more than one  event taking place, just in one tiny time window, which is something that we're going  to be using in just a moment. Now, when you look at Poisson processes,  there are many things that you can derive but one of the most important properties  is P(n,t), which is the probability of observing n events in a certain time window [0.t].  Now, by definition, what do we know? Well, by definition, we already know some  of these values because what we know is that the q is equal to P(1,delta_t), yes? q is the probability of having one event in a very tiny window delta_t  when the delta_t is small, which is equal then to lambda  delta_t when delta_t is small.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=1513.6s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Now, what we're gonna do now is  we're gonna be taking the limit when delta_t goes to zero. And this is going to lead us to a differential  equation, a system of differential equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=1744.72s
Networks: Part 1 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Yes. With the vectors of your basis. This is a very much like what  you do in linear algebra. Now something that is important to know is that  the P_hat(k,t), the Fourier transform of P(X,t), which by definition is the average  of exponential of minus ikX, actually provides information about  the moments of the distribution by looking at its behaviour for  small values of k. So we have that if we do a Taylor expansion for small values of k we have one minus ik average of X plus one  over two k-squared average of X-squared plus and so on, higher order terms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKgB0RnjeY#t=2933.92s
Networks: Part 4 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	We've talk about the degree distribution,  which is a way to characterise the diversity, the heterogeneity  that is present in the graph. But today what you do, what you would be  considering is something quite different.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_A6NbqpTW8#t=54.32s
Networks: Part 4 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	But you can also have other types of something,  usually called generalise communities, where in this case we'd have that there  are many connections in the group. Number one. Many connections between group number  one and group number two, many connection inside.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_A6NbqpTW8#t=430.24s
Networks: Part 4 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And what is the cut size? The cut size?  Let's see a type of graph like this. And that my two groups are this  one here and that one there. The cut size is the number of edges that go from  node of one group to node of the another group.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_A6NbqpTW8#t=986.32s
Networks: Part 4 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Quantity called Newman-Girvan Modularity. And  Newman-Girvan Modularity is defined as follows. It's defined as the fraction  of edges within communities. But the communities of the partition that you compare with the expected fraction  of such edges in an appropriate model.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_A6NbqpTW8#t=1615.84s
Networks: Part 4 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So here is, here is how it work. So here if you remember graph partitioning. We naturally had a Laplacian matrix here, but here actually will be focussing on the  matrix that is called the modularity matrix, which is this matrix that appears simply  in the expression here for modularity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_A6NbqpTW8#t=2032.64s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	It starts from China and go to other countries. That gives you a graph. In that graph You can measure a measure of distance between the origin and a certain destination along the shortest path.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=595.27s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And from there you can estimate an effective distance, graph-based distance between one country and another one. And if you now plot this time of the first occurrence of the disease with respect to this effective distance, you see a very nice linear correlation that clearly suggests that networks may be a good framework, may be better than just spatial modelling.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=610.12s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And in compartmental models, you assume that your population is composed of agents that are interacting with each other. And these agents can be in different states. Those would be different states associated to the disease. And these states can be seen as compartments.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=798.12s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And we see here that there is a threshold, a threshold below which there is no epidemic and above which we have a stationary state where the number of infected people remains non zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=1278.69s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And clearly here we see that the condition for having an endemic state, a state that would actually be prevalent and so non-zero. So for the disease basically to survive inside the population would be that's beta divided by mu And so it means that this state that we had here before would become unstable This happens if beta over mu is larger than the average of K tilde squared divided by the average of K tilde to the square times N tilde divided by N.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=2967.589s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And it basically means that almost for any value value of beta and mu You are going to be having that The state without disease is unstable, and so it means that if you have a graph ,a graph of, of cities that is extremely heterogeneous almost independently in the parameters, as you would always have, that the disease is going to be surviving.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=3091.92s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Now, over the last five years, so I was involved in a series of conferences that are called Higher Order Models in Network Science, where different scholars from mathematics, physics, theoretical computer science discussed and try to understand the limitations of networks as a model and maybe ways to improve on it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=4369.62s
Networks: Part 8 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Now, another limitation that people have emphasised is the fact that networks are not constant. Should just think about contact networks that we discussed about just a few videos ago. Clearly, contact networks are dynamical entities and the dynamics of edges are nontrivial processes that are affected by non-stationarities and and, for instance, circadian rhythm and and so periodic they have some periodic component to them But also they are not independent. And typically the emergence of a edge may have the effect of leading to the activation of another one. And there is a field, the research called Temporal Networks, where people are looking at networks as dynamical entities, usually as some stochastic models and well, if you're interested.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67xLOcA5Qbs#t=4556.59s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So what is a graph or what is a network? Well, - So a network is a system, Made of nodes, connected by links. The thing is, typically in the literature there are different ways to call the same things.  And the network is sometimes called a graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=41.12s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Graph or a network is basically the  combination of a set of V, a set of notes and E a set of edges. V is set of  nodes, the set of your elements.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=110.4s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	In that case each k_i is equal to a certain k. So if all of the notes have exactly the same value  of the degree, we said that the graph is regular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=936.72s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	I'm sorry for you. So how do we do with  it? Well, first of all, let's take a graph. We don't even need to consider  exactly who is connected to whom. So this is a graph where we have a certain node that is labelled  with degree one, four, one, one, two, three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=1394.56s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And so the first thing that you are interested  in would be the average degree, that is the average number of friends of a person. So if I have the double distribution,  this is simply obtained by doing a sum over the k's of k times p of k.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=1410.96s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So let's go. So what is a walk. A walk is a succession... A walk  is a succession of adjacent notes such that you can travel from one initial node to a final node. So, for instance, let's take this graph, the line provided  here, and we could have that I start from this node, I go like  this, I go like this, I go here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=1836.48s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Now, the thing is that there  are different types of walks, and amongst the walks there is a  certain type that is very important, and that's a walk called a  path. So, a path is a walk where each node is visited only once. So, for instance, this example  here was not a path because it's been going twice through that note here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=1923.04s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	We have the distance from i to j is  equal to the distance from j to i. And finally, to decide the triangle  inequality, the distance from i to j is smaller or equal to the distance from  i to l plus the distance from l to j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=2268.16s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	This means that even if the graph is huge, the billions of nodes actually  there exist many short cuts, many short paths that allow you to go from one  place to the graph to the other part of the graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=2588.24s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	We say it that two nodes are weakly  connected, if they're connected by a path. But when we forget about  the direction of the edges, we say that two nodes are strongly  connected if they are connected, if i is connected to j and j is connected to i, by paths that are basically constrained  by the direction of the edges.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=2731.6s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Or if there exist short walk or path  between any pair of nodes in the graph. In this video, we'll be looking at other  ways to measure some interesting information. To the notion of clustering measure,  measuring the density of triangles and graphs and proposing different notions of centrality, helping us to find out what are  the important nodes in the graph.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=2889.92s
Networks: Part 2 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So the way to do is the following.  So we're going to be saying that we will be interested in all  of the walks in the system. And you remember A_{ij}^l is the number of walks of length l between i and j. What  we say is that between i and j Well, we would expect that the shorter walks  should be more important than the longer ones.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5nVMG-Big#t=3773.68s
Networks: Part 3 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	Instead, what will happen is that we will  have a very nice transition taking place. And a critical value of the average connectivity,  such that when you're below the value you will basically have that there are no  large connected components in your graph, and after it, you start to see the emergence  of giant components inside your system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-rAUwQoaM#t=838.96s
Networks: Part 3 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And this is something that people do a lot  usually, when they consider Motif analysis. What is motif analysis? In motif analysis, what  you trying to do is to estimate if certain motifs that you observe in a graph  are significant or not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-rAUwQoaM#t=2055.36s
Networks: Part 3 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	But instead of fixing k_i, they would fix k_i in  and k_i out. So we would have an ensemble called directed configuration model where you  fix the in and out degrees of each node.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-rAUwQoaM#t=2191.36s
Networks: Part 3 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	So, typically, if Z score is very large, or very  positive or very negative, it'll be associated to statistical over representation, or statistical  under representation of certain motifs. And this is actually the essence of motif  analysis, a field of science that is, well a field of research very active, especially in Biology,  where people try to find certain building blocks that may have some biological nature or might  be associated to some biological function and by observing their anomalous statistical  representation you may, you may find out groups of nodes, that may actually have a  function together through this motif analysis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-rAUwQoaM#t=2300.16s
Networks: Part 3 - Oxford Mathematics 4th Year Student Lecture	And this is a very simple  recursive equation to solve, right? And if you solve it, you obtained  that. The P of k, the degree solution. The solution is going to be equal  to one divided by k, k + 1, k + 2, which basically behaves like k to the minus three, which is indeed the degree  solution that would behave like a power-law.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-rAUwQoaM#t=3037.52s
Geometry - Geodesics: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	And you get pi over 4, which because I want to compare actual numerical values, that approximates to 0.785. So Part 2 is the great circle. And let me define the great circle. This is the circle that passes through two points and contains the centre of the sphere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKsmPVR4WjM#t=776.13s
Geometry - Geodesics: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	OK. Well, generically, a great circle is any circle drawn on the sphere that contains the centre of the sphere. OK. In this picture, so let's draw our, our sphere again. And what we're supposing is that I have, say, Point A sitting here. And at this fixed latitude, maybe we put Point B right here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKsmPVR4WjM#t=859.78s
Geometry - Isometries and orthogonal matrices: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	For one just the, the word itself is made  up of iso, which means same and metries or metric, which is length, so same length. This is a really important type of map, distance  preserving, the maps that don't change the length, these, we can think of these as maps that don't  distort. This is a really important concept that we'll see a lot through the rest of the  course. Just to think of some simple examples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKEYUd3KgT0#t=112.16s
Geometry - Isometries and orthogonal matrices: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So let T be an isometry and let's consider for the moment isometry, an isometry that fixes the origin. So what I  mean is that T of zero vector is the zero vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKEYUd3KgT0#t=1866.8s
Geometry - Scalar Triple Product: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	OK, so we've seen two different operations we can do on vectors. We have the dot product, which takes two vectors and outputs a scalar, and the vector product that outputs a vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EmnCmdFkE#t=99.3s
Geometry - Scalar Triple Product: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So let's let u, v and w be vectors in R three. The scalar triple product is defined by taking the cross product with two of them and then dotting it with the other one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EmnCmdFkE#t=126.0s
Geometry - Scalar Triple Product: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	Then I get something like that, which is called a parallelepiped. Note that if u, v and w were all orthogonal to each other, so, for instance, if u v w were i j k, the basis for R three, then this becomes a unit cube. But for generic u v w, this has this sort of funny slanty shape. So the statement is that the volume of the parallelepiped is equal to the absolute value of the scalar triple product u v w.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EmnCmdFkE#t=903.0s
Geometry - Scalar Triple Product: Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	The volume contained in that box is going to be zero if and only if I squash the box. If and only if, very mathematically rigorous statement, the box is squashed. By squashed, we mean flat, and by flat, we mean that u, v and w are all living in the same plane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EmnCmdFkE#t=1407.0s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	You may not have come across the word  lemma before. We use lemma to mean a result that's going to be useful for  proving some later theorem or proposition. It's usually something that's not  particularly interesting in itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=286.74s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	Theorem tends to be something  that's kind of more important. But, yeah, lemma is something that's  going to be useful in the future. And another word that you might see used  is corollary, a corollary is a result that follows on from some theorem.   Usually it's like some kind of extension or a consequence of the theorem. OK, but this lemma,  I'm going to say, let N and K be natural numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=318.36s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	I quite like the set of emojis,  which I tend to use quite a lot. You can have all sorts of sets. Some other important ones that I  want to tell you about are intervals, which are subsets of the real numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=1627.62s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So an interval like this is called  a closed interval. And an interval like this that doesn't include the  endpoints is called an open interval. And you can mix and match, so you could have it  open on one hand and closed on the other end, and you just use a mixture of brackets then.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=1712.04s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	Both of those are bounded intervals, and  we can also have unbounded intervals. So we write A infinity - even though  infinity is not a real number this is the notation that we use - that means the set of X in the real numbers  such that X is larger than A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=1728.36s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	And this is an example of where we have duplicate  notation meaning completely different things. So on the previous slide, I  defined A B like this as meaning an interval, an open interval on the real line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=2009.46s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	They could be elements of some other set. OK, but this leads me on to the definition  of something called the Cartesian product. So I'm going to say, given sets  A and B, the Cartesian product, which we denote A cross B, is the set of all ordered pairs A B where A is from the set A and B is from the set B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=2063.04s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	And so, for example - this is an important  one that you'll see in geometry - if A is the set of real numbers, then the Cartesian product is R two, which is the set of points on a plane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=2141.58s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So Russell - Bertrand Russell -  was one of the mathematicians who helped kind of pioneer the development  of set theory around about 100 years ago. So we're going to suppose that we try to define the following set. H is going  to be the set containing sets which have the property that they  are not members of themselves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCev1nEiGqI#t=2268.9s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	Basically the set of all the students who I ever meet. We also have the intersection, so that's A intersect B. That is the set of all X in S such that X is in A and X is in B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=97.939s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	This is just for one of the sets. I call this A C that is the set of all X that are in S but that are not in A. I'll write That a bit better. X is not in A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=134.76s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	OK, so in that example, that would be the set of all students in Oxford and not studying maths - they don't know what they're missing out on. OK, then we have the set difference, which is A backslash B. That is the set of all X which are in A - in fact, maybe I should have just written it as in A - X is in A, but not in B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=158.41s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So if A and B were the regions inside those two circles, then A union B, for example, would be that region there. A intersect B would be like that region there. The complement of A, if A is the left hand circle - the region inside the left hand circle - then it would be the region outside of that. And A but not B would be the sort of moon shaped region there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=209.19s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So this time we're just going to need two subsets, so let A and B be subsets of S. Then we have two things. First of all, the complement of the union, A union B, is the intersection of the complement of A and the complement of B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=1194.13s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So if you remember that the power set is the set of all subsets of A, and so the cardinality of the powers set is the number of subsets of A. And there is quite an easy way to see this, if you think about how you produce a subset of A. If A has got N elements, then you could go through each of the N elements and decide whether you're going to put it in the subset or not.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=2457.13s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So we're going to split the power set of A, that's the set of all subsets, into those that contain the little A and those that don't. So let me write some explanation of that. I'm going to say that any subset of A either contains little A or not. So we can write (and this expression is going to be a bit long so I'll write it on the next line), we can write the power set of A as the union of two sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=2787.309s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	One of them will just be the power set of A primed - that's the set of all subsets of A primed - and then the other one so we're going to take the union of that with the other ones, which is the set of all subsets of A primed combined with the element little A.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=2826.349s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 3 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So anything that has the same cardinality as the natural numbers is called a countable set, and if it's larger than that, then it's called uncountable. So I'll just say here, but the cardinality of the natural numbers is the same as a cardinality of the integers, and that's the same as the cardinality of the rationals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYM0gaPU-8g#t=3102.46s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 1 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So here I'm going to let M and N be natural numbers. I say that we write M is less than or equal to N to mean that there exists some other natural, which I'll call K, such that M plus K is equal to N.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS6R3epK3ms#t=527.18s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 1 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So a subset I haven't defined yet, but a subset of the natural numbers is some set of natural numbers, but maybe not all of them. Being non-empty means that it contains at least one number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS6R3epK3ms#t=2448.03s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 5 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	The function has to assign a value F of X to every X that we could put into it. The set X is called the domain of the function. Domain. And the set Y is called the codomain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwPxQY2CQA#t=77.86s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 5 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So for any real number X, it's the least integer that's larger than or equal to that. And as I say, this is sometimes called the ceiling function. And it's sometimes denoted with sort of half square brackets around the X. There's a similar function called the floor function, which is the largest integer that's less than or equal to X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwPxQY2CQA#t=228.89s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 5 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	These are quite important properties. So these are some definitions. So we're going to let F from X to Y be a function. And I'm going to define two things. The first is F being injective. So I'll say F is injective, or sometimes this is called one to one, or sometimes written as one one, if... so to be injective it means that no two elements in the domain can map onto the same place in the codomain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwPxQY2CQA#t=1118.14s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 5 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So I'm going to say just a word about that, and then I'm going to talk mostly about composition of functions and then about invertability. So I'm going to start off with a definition, a second definition, of the cardinality of a finite set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwPxQY2CQA#t=1664.87s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 5 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So it must be the case that the cardinality of Y is larger than equal to the cardinality of X. This is something called the pigeonhole principle. So this is the idea that if you have a certain number of letters and you're going to try and distribute them amongst a certain number of pigeonholes, if you have more letters than you have pigeonholes, then it's guaranteed that one of the pigeonholes will end up with two or more letters in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwPxQY2CQA#t=1814.95s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 4 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	I'm now going to talk about relations. So these are things like less than or equal to, which compare two objects in a set. So I'm going to start with the definition. So we're going to say a relation, which we'll denote R - typically we're going to relate to objects that are in the same set, but we can relate objects in different sets and I'm going to write down a definition for that more general case - so I'm going to say that the relation is on sets A and B. And the way we define it is going to seem slightly strange, but we're actually going to define it as a subset of the Cartesian product A cross B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mM570_u70#t=1121.419s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 4 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So obviously less than or equal to we use a less than or equal to symbol. Another example of a relation would be equals, and I'm going to struggle with my notation here. So equals, as a relation, is the subset which includes one one, two two and three three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mM570_u70#t=1297.49s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 4 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So I'm going to write down a definition. A relation R is called a partial order if it is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. And it can lead to an ordering. It's called a total order if in addition to that, for any X and Y in the set, either X is related to Y or Y is related to X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mM570_u70#t=1789.47s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 4 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So indeed it is transitive. OK, and any relation that has these properties of being reflective, symmetric and transitive is called an equivalence relation. So this is an example of that. So I'm going to write out a definition now of an equivalence relation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mM570_u70#t=2103.92s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 4 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	If I took S to be the set of polygons in R two. And then I could define an equivalence relation as two polygons being equivalent if they are congruent, so I'll say the equivalence relation is in that case congruence, meaning that two polygons are equivalent if one of them can be translated and rotated into the other one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mM570_u70#t=2313.93s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 7 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	The square root of X times Y is the geometric mean of X and Y, and the half X plus Y is the arithmetic mean. So this theorem is saying that the geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53vfipKsnFk#t=555.99s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 7 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	And sometimes you might end up arriving at something which is just complete nonsense. The Latin name for proof by contradiction is reductio ad absurdum, which means reduction to an absurdity, which... sometimes it feels a bit like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53vfipKsnFk#t=837.709s
Introduction to University Mathematics: Lecture 7 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	The last thing I want to say is about counterexamples. Counterexamples provide a method for refuting or disproving some claim, rather than proving it. So for refuting or disproving a statement. And there's not really much to say about these. If you think that a statement is not true, then you disprove it by saying here is a counterexample, and you don't really need to do anything else other than just say, well here it is - it doesn't work. I guess the thing to say is that you shouldn't just search randomly for counterexamples, because that's not usually going to work very well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53vfipKsnFk#t=1462.86s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	Then the other component of q would be in the  tangential direction which would stay inside, so we would have that the outward flow is q.n where n is the outward unit normal to the surface in general if we have a  surface, okay, and that's called so if q so that if you have something like  this, then the directional derivative of some vector, call it, say you have some  directional derivative, is called dq/dn.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p39xHiUnjIg#t=275.94s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	As soon as an organism becomes bigger than  roughly speaking one millimeter in diameter, it has to have complicated systems  for moving nutrient and oxygen around. Now another organism that you can  think of as an organism is cancer, and when cancer, when it becomes of speaking one  millimeter in diameter, it starts to die in the center because there's not enough oxygen,  and what the cancer cells do then is they form their own vasculature by  hijacking the vasculature of the body and building their own vastature, and their own  vastature, because it's immature to begin with, there's holes in the vasculature and the cells  can move into the vasculature, and then flow to different parts of the body and that's  called metastasis, or a secondary tumor and so you see here we're talking  about length scales of one millimeter which are very difficult to detect right? I mean you wouldn't notice from doing this that there's a lump of one millimeter on your body, but  if oxygen, if the diffusion coefficient of oxygen, was much larger so that maybe you could grow to  a centimeter before you needed a blood supply, then you would be able to detect it and  get it removed before it did any harm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p39xHiUnjIg#t=1515.6s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 2 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So the solution we calculated from doing  the Fourier series to find out there's a solution as Tt goes to infinity you  get this solution that's constant. We now see why that makes sense both physically  and mathematically from looking at this equation okay, and this final solution that we get T  equals constant, we call that a steady state of the problem. So steady state means it doesn't change in time, okay. So if you were asked calculate the steady states of this problem, you would  say steady state means time derivative is zero, so dT by dt equals zero at the steady  state that implies it's total derivative because Big T doesn't depend on  Little t it just depends on x .	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p39xHiUnjIg#t=2787.78s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 1 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	"Okay and put the A, which we assume is constant,  and we're assuming the density is constant. Right so if you think about it, if you  take now a little tiny delta x in here, then the volume of that will  be a times delta x because it's a disk with circular area a height dx. So volume is a times delta x multiplied by rho, which gives you the mass. Okay  so that's the mass of this little volume, and the that little volume if delta X  is very small will have exposed to temperature t and then what we have to do is you  have to say ""Okay how does that temperature T convert into heat?"" So heat is related to temperature, so there must be a constant of  conversion and that constant is called C, or is called in the notes CV. That's called the specific heat capacity, which is the energy required to heat up a kilogram by one degree Kelvin."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPn5qDVm4so#t=199.38s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 1 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	So we're going to do to begin with is assume that  there's no source, so the only way the heat is changing is due to the movement of the heat, okay. So that means what we're going to have is a times q(a, t) so what's q(a,t)? q(a,t) is the flow, normally called flux of heat per unit time per unit area at a in the positive x direction at time t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPn5qDVm4so#t=501.36s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 1 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	And, so this is Fourier's law. So Fourier's law states, or  the law of heat conduction, the rate of heat (well  sometimes it's called transfer, sometimes called flow, sometimes called flux,  it's all the same rate of heat transfer q) is equal to minus k dT/dx where  k is called thermal conductivity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPn5qDVm4so#t=944.04s
The Heat Equation: Lecture 1 - Oxford Mathematics 1st Year Student Lecture	Now we talked about this, it's called the heat  equation, because this is the movement of heat. Okay but it could be anything else, it  could be molecules of a chemical moving, so it doesn't matter what the T is as long as you  multiply by the right parameters here to convert the values in the right way. What you end up getting is this, which becomes a general formula with  some other constant here for the movement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPn5qDVm4so#t=1200.06s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So the real numbers always denoted by  blackboard bold or a bold letter R. Let's just briefly run over  some of their properties, which we covered in the prelims course. So the least upper bound property, every non-empty bounded subset S of the reals has a least  upper bound, usually denoted by sup of S.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=129.92s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Very similarly any non-empty  bounded subset of the reals has a greatest lower bound,  usually denoted by inf of s. The real numbers have the  Bolzano–Weierstrass property; any bounded sequence of real numbers  has a convergent subsequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=170.08s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	The d 1 distance between vectors v and w is the sum from i equals one to n of  the absolute value of v i minus w i. So that's the d 1 distance. we've then got the d  2 distance, which is the usual Euclidean distance, which is the sum of the squares of the v i  minus the w i, all of that square rooted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=740.96s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So the Euclidean norm, which is also known  as the l 2 norm, so norm of v in l 2, Is the sum of the squares of the v i's,  the components of v, all square rooted And that can also be written in  terms of the Euclidean inner product.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=816.8s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Now, the left hand side here, norm x plus y  squared, can be expanded as an inner product, inner product of x plus y with x plus y. And because inner products  are bilinear, I can write This as a sum of four terms. It's inner  product of x and x plus inner product of y and x plus inner product of x  and y plus inner product of y and y which is the norm x plus the norm of y plus  the contribution from the two cross terms, And they're both equal to the  inner products of x and y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=906.16s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And then you can define the distance between x and y to be the number of  coordinates in which x and y differ, So the number of zeros that you'd have to flip  to ones or vice versa to get between the string x and the string y - that's  called the Hamming distance, and that's a vastly important notion of distance  that comes up in theoretical computer science.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=1409.36s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 1 & 2: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And finally, we'll mentioned one from  geometry, projective space, so P of R to the n, This is the set of lines through the  origin, so directions through the origin. And then you can define a distance on  projective space in the following manner.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvaFeNLZ9s8#t=1433.2s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 9 & 10: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	f inverse, the pre image under f, of  the ball of radius epsilon about f of a, And then if you apply f to both sides of  that, you get that f of the ball of radius.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y36y3w7A0L4#t=721.04s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 9 & 10: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So what this does is it takes  half open zero one and identifies. One with zero. So we map a point x  in that interval to x modulo one. So the half open interval from zero  to half, that is an open set in.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y36y3w7A0L4#t=800.32s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 9 & 10: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So the Y ball centred on a point of radius r is the set of all things in Y whose distance  from the centre point is less than r. Whereas the X ball is the set of all things in X whose distance  from the centre point is less than r.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y36y3w7A0L4#t=1125.76s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 9 & 10: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So let's look at a couple of examples. Suppose  that X is the Euclidian plane, R squared, and that Y is the subspace  consisting just of the X axis. So R cross the point zero, the set of  all things whose Y coordinate is zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y36y3w7A0L4#t=1162.88s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So we've got the sequence of x ns. We'll call that sigma. And because X is sequentially compact, that has a convergent subsequence that I'll call sigma primed, consisting of the x sub n sub ks for k equals one, two, three and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=813.93s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	But the same name is sometimes given to a more general result that holds in R to the n. So sometimes we call this the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, that any closed and bounded subset of R to the n is sequentially compact.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=991.6s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So this is what's sometimes known as Bolzano–Weierstrass: a closed bounded subset of R to the n is sequentially compact. And then you can combine this with the result I proved at the start of the lecture to conclude, for example, that a continuous, real-valued function on a closed and bounded subset of R to the n is bounded and attains its bounds.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=1084.32s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And then we'll define a sequence of functions f n as follows: f n of t is phi of t minus n, so these are kind of shifted spikes. This is a spike of width one about the point n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=1470.75s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Let me tell you what total boundedness means. A metric space is said to be totally bounded if for every epsilon, you can cover it with finitely many balls of radius epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=1568.51s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Well, now, let's take a sequence of elements of X, call it sigma. What I want to do to show that X is sequentially compact is to find a convergence subsequence of sigma.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=1847.55s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 19 & 20: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And let sigma to the (nought) be the infinite subsequence of sigma consisting of the elements of sigma that lie in that ball. So by construction, it is infinite. So I've not got to subsequence sigma to the (nought) of sigma, and all of the elements of that subsequence are contained in just one ball of radius one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlOzMXA0Vs#t=1902.49s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And let's define delta to be the distance between a and b. Now, if I take epsilon to be delta over 2 in the definition of the limit, what we see is that if N is big enough, then the distance from x n to a is less than delta over 2 And so is the distance from x n to b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=133.39s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Then we say that a function f from big X to big Y is uniformly continuous if for every epsilon greater than zero, There is a delta greater than zero such that for any little x and little y in big X, if the distance between them is less than delta and the distance between the f values is less than epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=295.69s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So we'll be looking at examples of what are called function spaces. Now, actually, having said that, the first example is one that we could have introduced a while ago. And this is the set of bounded functions on an arbitrary set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=913.12s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So let X be any set. And then we define B of X to be the space of all functions, f, from X to the real numbers for which the set of values taken by f is a bounded set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=928.089s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Now, if f is a bounded function, we define its sup norm, Or its infinity norm, to be the supremum over all little x in big X of absolute value f of little x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=941.649s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Then we'll define C of X to be the space of all continuous functions, f from X to R. Now, in the last lecture, we introduced the notion of a continuous function between two metric spaces, X and Y. Here the target space Y is the real numbers R, with the usual metric.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=991.959s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 5 & 6: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	There's also a big L p norm, defined as the integral from zero to one of absolute value f of t to the p. All of that to the power one upon p. And that's also a norm.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1SLnUihCm8#t=1551.68s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 11 & 12: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So the interior is denoted by int of S  usually, sometimes by S with a little circle to the top right of it. The closure, which is usually denoted by S bar, is defined to be the intersection of  all closed subsets of X which contain S.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wqGTXZuvJw#t=54.08s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 11 & 12: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Now, occasionally, we won't see  it much more in this course. We also would talk about the boundary of S,  which is the closure with the interior removed. So S bar backslash the interior of S that sometimes denoted by a kind  of partial or boundary symbol of S.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wqGTXZuvJw#t=73.44s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 3 & 4: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Little l two is the space of sequences such that the sum of the squares of those elements is finite. And then little l infinity is the space of bounded sequences, sequences for which the sup of x n is finite.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFAo66CRM#t=526.02s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 3 & 4: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So that's the definition of an open ball. And similarly, we define the closed ball of radius epsilon about a, and we write that as B bar of a, epsilon, that's defined to be the the set of all x in big X, such that the distance from little x to little a is less than or equal to epsilon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFAo66CRM#t=1083.38s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 3 & 4: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	OK. So the fact that one implies two really is obvious, if Y is contained in an open ball, say, a radius R then it is also contained in a closed ball, the closed ball with the same centre and the same radius.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFAo66CRM#t=1237.7s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 13 & 14: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Let's look first at the space of bounded functions on a set X. Let's just recall what it is. So X here is just an arbitrary set, and B(X) is the norm vector space consisting of all bounded functions from X to the reals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2su2osDcoQo#t=35.079s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 13 & 14: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And that has the subnorm, or infinity norm, placed upon it, defined to be the supremum over all x in X of the absolute value of f(x). And here's the theorem: for every set X, the space B(X) Of bounded functions on X is a complete metric space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2su2osDcoQo#t=50.6s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 13 & 14: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And we say that two Cauchy sequences are equivalent well, basically if it looks towards that, if it looks like they should be tending towards the same limit. So the definition is that two Cauchy sequences are equivalent, if I call those sequences x and x', then they're equivalent if and only if x_n minus x'_n tends to zero as n tends to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2su2osDcoQo#t=1496.23s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 15 & 16: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So we say that a metric space is disconnected, somehow can be separated  into two different blocks. So if you can write it as the disjoint  union of two non-empty open sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L1Wh9qaE8o#t=46.32s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 15 & 16: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And we say that the space is connected, if you  can't do that, so if it's not disconnected. If you can disconnect it, if you  write it as a disjoint union of two, not-empty sets U and V, then we  say that those two sets disconnect X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L1Wh9qaE8o#t=61.04s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 15 & 16: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	The set of real numbers strictly  greater than two is an interval, the set of real numbers greater  than or equal to two is an interval. So all of those are intervals. So that's  a complete classification of the connected subsets of the real line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L1Wh9qaE8o#t=1394.48s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 15 & 16: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So some of those points will lie in  U and some of them will lie in V. And we'll define S to be the  set of all z between x and y, so all z inclosed in [x,y] for which z lies in U.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L1Wh9qaE8o#t=1656.0s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Equicontinuity means that more than that, you can choose delta to be uniform in the choice of function f as well, as f ranges over this family curly F. So if you like, you can think of it as a kind of uniform, uniform continuity or uniform continuity in a family curly F.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=403.18s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So that's an open cover. Now, a subcover is a covering of X by a subset of those U is. So, if J is a subset of the indexing set capital I, And if the sets U sub little i for i in J also cover X, so if their union is also X, that we say that this is a subcover of the cover curly U.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=1376.769s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So we say that a subcollection of these U is is a subcover if Y is contained in their union. And then we say that Y is compact if and only if every open cover has a finite subcover.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=1574.499s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So A n is the set of all elements of the sequence from X n onwards. And obviously, those are nested. So A one is the whole sequence; that contains A two, which is the sequence with x one removed; that contains A three, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=1819.03s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	We're going to do two things in this lecture. First of all, we'll prove what's called the Heine–Borel theorem, which is the statement that any closed bounded subinterval of R is compact.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=1980.44s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And then we'll show that compactness and sequential compactness are one and the same thing in metric spaces. So let's look at the Heine–Borel theorem. And this is the statement that the closed interval a b is compact.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=1992.659s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	That's what it means for a b to be compact. So we define the set S as follows. We define it to be the set of all x in the interval a b for which the closed interval from a up to x does have a finite subcover by these U is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=2041.49s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 21, 22 & 23: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So for each m natural number, one, two, three and so on, I will take a collection of balls, finite collection of balls B one to the (m) up to B sub k m to the (m), the radius of those balls being two to the minus m, and they cover the space X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9KDjFaU04#t=2454.01s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 17 & 18: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	The path connected space is one for which there  is a path between any two points in that space. Now, let's just make a few  comments about paths in general. If you have two paths, gamma_1 and gamma_2 in X, and if the end points of gamma_1  is the start points of gamma_2, so if gamma_1(1) = gamma_2(0), then  you can concatenate those paths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEEWpYEi2mU#t=90.16s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 17 & 18: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	Now X is open, and so there is a ball, little  ball of radius epsilon contained in X about a. Let's let b be a point in that ball. And then I can write down the  following path gamma from a to b.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEEWpYEi2mU#t=582.48s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 17 & 18: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So that's a contradiction. And  therefore, if Y is not bounded, I managed to find a subsequence  without a convergent— A sequence without a convergent subsequence.  Therefore, Y could not be sequentially compact.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEEWpYEi2mU#t=1869.12s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 7 & 8: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So let's give a few examples of homeomorphisms. Here's one, the closed disk of radius one. So the set of all points whose Euclidean distance from the origin in R2 is less than or equal to one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZEya3gfoA#t=300.78s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 7 & 8: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And suppose that I've got a subset U of X, which could be empty. It could be the whole space X or anything in between. I say that it's open and more precisely, I say it's open in X, if for every point y in that set U there's a positive delta such that the open ball of radius delta about y is contained in U.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZEya3gfoA#t=868.94s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 7 & 8: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So for every point in the set U there's a whole ball around that point. That's also contained in U. That's the definition of open set. So let's give some examples. So what we normally term the open interval open zero one is an open set in R.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZEya3gfoA#t=891.119s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 7 & 8: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	And that's less than epsilon primed plus epsilon minus epsilon primed, which is equal to epsilon. Another key concept in the theory of metric spaces is that of a closed set. So closed sets are the complements of open sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZEya3gfoA#t=1129.559s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 7 & 8: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	So here is an example. Let's consider these open sets on the real line. So U i is the open interval of width one over i about zero. So that's the interval from minus one over i up to one over i. Those are all open.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZEya3gfoA#t=1609.95s
Metric Spaces - Lectures 7 & 8: Oxford Mathematics 2nd Year Student Lecture	But the collection of all of the open sets in a metric space X is called the topology on X. So the last thing I want to do in this chapter is just to go over quickly the analogue of that previous proposition for closed sets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZEya3gfoA#t=1652.759s
Math Antics - Decimal Place Value	The digit ‘2’ in the hundreds-place represents two hundreds, the ‘3’ in the tens-place represents three tens (or thirty), and the ‘5’ in the ones-place represents five ones (or just 5). It’s a pretty amazing system if you think about it! It only has 10 digits, but those digits can be re-used in different combinations to count any number from zero, all the way to trillions of apples and beyond! But!… as amazing as it is, there’s just one little problem with our number system so far… [Crunch] What if you don’t have a whole apple? In the Place Value video, we only learned how to count whole amounts, or what we call “whole numbers”, which is the set of numbers you get if you start with 0 and then count by ones: 1,2,3,4… and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6ILNOiMgM#t=35.729s
Math Antics - Decimal Place Value	But now we know that number places can extend in BOTH directions, so we need a new way to tell which place is which. What we need is a point of reference… a place that we always start from.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6ILNOiMgM#t=226.52s
Math Antics - Decimal Place Value	If a number does have decimal digits, then we call it a “decimal number” and the decimal point helps us quickly recognize which digit is in the ones place. For example, if you see a sequence of digits like this: 1, 2, 6, point, 5, 3 You can tell right away that the digit ‘6’ is in the ones place, because it’s immediately to the left of the decimal point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6ILNOiMgM#t=282.95s
Math Antics - Decimal Place Value	Since the ones place counts by ‘ones’, the number place to the right of it should count by amounts that are ten times smaller than one. The amount that’s ten times smaller than one is called “a tenth”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6ILNOiMgM#t=337.352s
Math Antics - Decimal Place Value	So if the tenths place counts fractions that are a tenth of ONE, then the next place over will count amounts that are one tenth of A TENTH! One tenth of a tenth is called ‘one hundredth’.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6ILNOiMgM#t=490.506s
Math Antics - Rounding	And doing that makes the rounded number smaller, even if the ‘target’ digit stays the same. On the other hand, increasing the ‘target’ digit by one is called “rounding up”, since the new rounded number will be larger than the original number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd-E18EqSVk#t=311.31s
Math Antics - Place Value	Seeing all these number places together helps you understand what we mean by ‘place value’. In a multi-digit number, the number PLACE that a digit is in, determines it’s VALUE. Even though we only have ten digits, each digit can stand for different amounts depending on the place that it occupies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Qf0qSSJFI#t=374.816s
Math Antics - Fractions and Decimals	Number places are like counters that hold one digit at a time and help us count how many of each ‘Base 10’ building block a number is made of. There are ‘Base 10’ building blocks like 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 that help us make really big numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mst8iZjIpFE#t=505.478s
Math Antics - Fractions and Decimals	There are also very small ‘Base 10’ building blocks (fractions that are smaller than ‘1’) that help us make really small numbers. These building blocks have names like tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mst8iZjIpFE#t=521.467s
Math Antics - Fractions and Decimals	The decimal point is a separator that goes between the number places that count values of ‘1’ or greater, from the number places that count values smaller than ‘1’. To make sure you understand how decimals work and how they relate to fractions, be sure to do those exercises! …bet ya didn’t see that coming, did ya! Learn more at www.mathantics.com	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mst8iZjIpFE#t=534.023s
Math Antics - Comparing Fractions	If you convert each fraction to a decimal, you’ll see that they both have the value 0.375 Two fractions that have different top and bottom numbers, but the same value are called ‘equivalent fractions’.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNdUJQ_qd4U#t=347.892s
Math Antics - Fractions Are Division	We need to learn what a fractions really are. A fraction is just a number that’s written like a division problem. You remember division right? …where you take one number and divide it up by another number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xwDryouw6o#t=17.924s
Math Antics - Fractions Are Division	The bottom number is the number we’re dividing by, and we call it the ‘denominator’. Now let’s look at some of the common fractions that you’re already familiar with and think of them as division problems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xwDryouw6o#t=87.075s
Math Antics - Working With Parts	Now that we know how to use fractions to represent parts of a whole, there's a few different things we can do with them. First of all, we can compare fractions. Comparing fractions means checking to see if one fraction is greater than, less than, or equal to another fraction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDc_-GTipBk#t=6.901s
Math Antics - Working With Parts	That means these two fractions are equal! It might seem strange that two fractions can have totally different numbers and still represent the same amount, but they can! Fractions like that are called ‘Equivalent Fractions’.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDc_-GTipBk#t=125.26s
Math Antics - Working With Parts	Using drawings, we can compare fractions to see which one represents the greatest amount. If we compare two different fractions and find that they represent the same amount, then we call them equivalent fractions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDc_-GTipBk#t=318.612s
Math Antics - Types of Fractions	Any fractions that have values in this range are called ‘Proper Fractions’ because we can use these values to represent smaller parts of things. Our third rule is this:  If the top number and the bottom number are the same, then the value of the fraction is always just one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17IgK9b6P2M#t=71.794s
Math Antics - What Are Percentages?	But a percent isn’t just any old fraction.  A percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number. If it’s a percent, then no matter what the top number is, the bottom number will be 100.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeVSmq1Nrpw#t=79.067s
Math Antics - What Are Percentages?	Alright, so now you know that a percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number. And you know that you can re-write percents in either their fraction form OR their decimal form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeVSmq1Nrpw#t=468.5s
Math Antics - Percents And Equivalent Fractions	You might already know that equivalent fractions are fractions that represent the same amount or value, but they do it with different top and bottom numbers. A simple example of equivalent fractions is 1 over 2 and 2 over 4.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmVfZ9o-2gg#t=85.095s
Math Antics - Percents And Equivalent Fractions	These fractions both represent the same value (one-half) but they use different numbers to do it. And that’s how percents can be used even if the total isn’t 100. A percent is an equivalent fraction that tells you how much you’d have IF the total WAS 100.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmVfZ9o-2gg#t=99.967s
Algebra Basics: What Is Algebra? - Math Antics	"An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NybHckSEQBI#t=86.319s
Math Antics - Proportions	A proportion is just two ratios that are equivalent (or equal). Oh, and one thing that’s really important to remember… In order for two ratios to be equivalent, they not only have to have the same value, they also have to have the same units.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USmit5zUGas#t=105.565s
Math Antics - Ratios And Rates	It says here that a ratio is a “comparison of two numbers by division”. Well that’s true, but it’s also a little confusing. It’s confusing because most of us think of comparing numbers as trying to decide if a number is greater that, less than, or equal to another number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ2nYUBVvqI#t=16.48s
Math Antics - Ratios And Rates	Well I guess you have an answer for everything, don’t you? 40 miles per 1 hour is a type of ratio that we call a rate. A rate is just a ratio that usually involves a period of time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ2nYUBVvqI#t=339.16s
Math Antics - Order Of Operations	Hi and welcome to Math Antics. Today we’re gonna talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations. Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations (like addition or multiplication) to do first.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAgfnK528RA#t=6.857s
Math Antics - Order Of Operations	Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards, and they’re used in pairs like this. And when we put numbers and operators in between them, it forms a group. It’s almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAgfnK528RA#t=156.509s
Math Antics - Number Patterns	In math, when you have a set of numbers or elements where the order matters, it’s called a “Sequence”. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3 is different than the sequence 3, 2, 1 even though they each contain the same “set” of numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV7C7bXm4VI#t=85.688s
Math Antics - Number Patterns	And in math, the word “Set” refers to a group of numbers or elements where the order doesn’t matter AND where any duplicates are left out. For example, if you had the sequence 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1 the set of numbers in that sequence is just 1, 2, 3 even though each number occurred twice in the sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV7C7bXm4VI#t=100.572s
Math Antics - Number Patterns	Sequences that are based on addition or subtraction rules are called “Arithmetic Sequences” while sequences that are based on multiplication or division rules are called “Geometric Sequences”. Those maybe aren’t the most intuitive names, but since they’ve been used for so long, it’s important to know what people mean when they say them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV7C7bXm4VI#t=568.659s
Math Antics - Number Patterns	The common difference is a constant amount that’s either added or subtracted to each new element. Since the common difference here is 4 and the sequence is increasing, that means the rule for this sequence is probably ‘add 4’.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV7C7bXm4VI#t=680.308s
Math Antics - What Is Arithmetic?	That’s addition… it combines two amounts. The subtraction operation tells us to take one number away from another number. In other words, if we start with an amount (like 5) and we subtract (or take away) the amount 3 from it, we have only 2 left over.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwW0GJWKH98#t=73.722s
Math Antics - What Is Arithmetic?	Subtraction takes an amount away from another amount. The multiplication operation tells us to take one number and then repeat it a certain number of times. It’s basically just repeated addition. For example, if we have the amount 5 and we multiply it by 3, that mean we combine 3 groups of 5 to get a total of 15.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwW0GJWKH98#t=92.145s
Math Antics - What Is Arithmetic?	So 5 times 3 is the same as 5 + 5 + 5  …see how it’s just repeated addition? Multiplication takes an amount and repeats it a number of times. And finally, the division operation tells us to take a number and divide it into a certain number of equal groups.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwW0GJWKH98#t=115.219s
Math Antics - What Is Arithmetic?	Specifically, it tells us that two amounts are equal, which is why it’s called “the equal sign”. In arithmetic, the equal sign is used to show what the answer is to an operation or a set of operations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwW0GJWKH98#t=249.685s
Math Antics - What Is Arithmetic?	The answer to an addition problem is called a “sum”. The answer to a subtraction problem is called a “difference”. The answer to a multiplication problem is called a “product”. and the answer to a division problem is called a “quotient”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwW0GJWKH98#t=285.5s
Math Antics - Prime Factorization	Now a prime numbers is just a number that has exactly two factors: itself and 1. There’s a lot of prime numbers. Here’s a list of all the prime numbers that are less than 20: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbOiYhHY2c#t=80.496s
Math Antics - Prime Factorization	And each of these combinations is called the “prime factorization” of its composite number. AH… so the ‘prime factorization’ is a THING. It’s the set of prime numbers that you multiply together to get another number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbOiYhHY2c#t=175.647s
Math Antics - Prime Factorization	We’re gonna use prime factorization (the action) to find the prime factorization (the set of prime factors) for the number 12. And that just means that we’ll continue to factor 12 until all the factors are prime numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbOiYhHY2c#t=200.02s
Math Antics - Prime Factorization	Now to do this, I’m gonna use something called a ‘factor tree’. A factor tree is just a diagram that helps you keep track of multiple factoring steps. When you factor a number, you write the two factors below it with lines (or branches) going to them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbOiYhHY2c#t=214.278s
Math Antics - Prime Factorization	Alright… now you know what prime numbers are, and you know how to use prime factorization to find the set of prime factors that a composite number is made of. And that set of numbers is ALSO called its prime factorization.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbOiYhHY2c#t=371.12s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this video, we’re going to learn about special  kinds of polygons called Quadrilaterals. Quadrilateral is just a fancy math word for a polygon that has exactly 4 sides and 4 angles… like this one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=6.94s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	This is what we call a rectangle. A rectangle is a quadrilateral that still has 4 equal angles (notice that when we stretched the square, the angles didn’t change at all) but it does NOT have 4 equal sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=75.64s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	Ah... what we have now is called a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral that still has 4 equal sides, but it does NOT have 4 equal angles. And once again, just like the square and rectangle, the rhombus is made from two pairs of parallel sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=106.219s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	Okay... going back once more to our square... what if we try changing BOTH the sides AND the angles. Here’s what we end up with... and we call it, a parallelogram. It’s called a parallelogram because, even though it’s sides are not all equal, and it’s angles are not all equal, it’s still made from two pairs of parallel sides.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=124.02s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	And a quadrilateral that has only ONE pair of parallel sides is called... a trapezoid. Well actually, this is where classifying Quadrilaterals gets a little messy. That’s because this sort of shape is called a trapezoid in America, but it’s called a trapezium in other countries like the U.K.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=202.85s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	We don’t think it needs a special name, so we’re just going to call it a quadrilateral. So to summarize, any polygon that has exactly four sides is called a quadrilateral. And if it has no parallel sides, we still just call it a quadrilateral.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=310.71s
Math Antics - Quadrilaterals	But if it has one, and only one, pair of parallel sides, we call it a trapezoid (or a trapezium). Or, if it has two pairs of parallel sides, we call it a parallelogram.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiREqzDsMP8#t=324.94s
Math Antics - Angles & Degrees	In fact, you might wonder if there could be any angle smaller than 1 degree. Yep, there sure are. And we saw one just a second ago. Before we rotated our top ray, when our rays were exactly on top of each other, that is a zero degree angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n3KZR1DSEo#t=127.42s
Math Antics - Angles & Degrees	Yep, a right angle is exactly 90 degrees, and that is super important to memorize because right angles are used all the time in geometry. Okay, do you remember from our last video that all angles less than a right angle are called acute angles? So that means that all the angles we've seen so far that are between 0 and 90 degrees (like 10, 30, 45, 60 and so on) are acute angles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n3KZR1DSEo#t=216.36s
Math Antics - Points, Lines, & Planes	Hi there! Today on Math Antics we're starting a new subject where we're going to learn the basics of a special kind of math called Geometry. Geometry is the study of things like lines, shapes, angles, distances and things like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5etrWdIY6o#t=0.139s
Math Antics - Points, Lines, & Planes	We call it a 'ray'. Rays have beginning points, but no ending points. They just keep on going forever... but only in one direction.  So we only put an arrow on the end that keeps going.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5etrWdIY6o#t=182.48s
Math Antics - Points, Lines, & Planes	You can go up and down, or you can go left and right. A line, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional object. If you're on a line, like 'line AB', there's only one dimension that you can travel in.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5etrWdIY6o#t=263.989s
Math Antics - Points, Lines, & Planes	A three-dimensional space like this is often called a 'volume', but we'll talk all about 3D volumes in another video. For now, let's get back to talking about planes. Earlier in the video, we learned that you can make a line by connecting any two points, right? Well, in order to make a plane, it turns out that you need to have three points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5etrWdIY6o#t=356.15s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	When two lines are arranged like this,  we call them 'parallel'. You've probably heard the term 'parallel' before…  like parallel parking, or a parallel universe, or parallel bars. Okay, so parallel lines are lines that will never cross, even if they go on forever...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=41.88s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Let's name it Point P. When lines cross at a point like this,  we say that they intersect, and we call the point an 'intersection'. And when lines intersect, they form 'angles'.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=70.5s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Perpendicular lines are lines that form square corners when they intersect. And these square corner angles have a special name in Geometry because they are really important. We call them 'right angles'.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=216.43s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Instead, we have an angle that is smaller (or less) than a right angle. Angles that are less than right angles  are called 'acute angles'. On the other hand, if we rotated our ray to the left instead of the right, we would get an angle that's bigger  or greater than a right angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=265.6s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Angles that are greater than right angles  are called 'obtuse angles'. So, there are three main kinds of angles  that you need to know about. Right Angles, acute angles and obtuse angles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=281.64s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Well actually, there's one more type of  angle that's pretty important, but it's kind of a strange one.  It's called a 'straight angle'. A straight angle is just what we get when we rotate our rays so that they point in exactly opposite directions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=293.08s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	And in geometry, any two angles that to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'. And we can do the same thing with a straight angle. If we take a straight angle (made from two rays) and divide it with a third ray, two new smaller angles are formed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=334.88s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Lines that point in exactly the same direction will never cross and are called 'parallel' lines. When lines do cross, they cross at a point called an 'intersection'. Lines that intersect form 'angles'. You can think of angles as the spaces between the lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=376.76s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	Angles can be named by the points that form them... just like connect the dots. An 'arc' is a part of a circle. Arcs can be used to represent an angle between two intersecting lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=393.86s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	When intersecting lines form all exactly equal angles, the lines are 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines form 'right angles'. Right angles are square corners, and we use a special square symbol  to show that an angle is a right angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=406.6s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	An angle that's smaller, or less than a right angle is called an 'acute angle'. An angle that's bigger, or greater than a right angle is called an 'obtuse angle'. A 'straight angle' is formed by two rays pointing in exactly opposite directions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=423.56s
Math Antics - Angle Basics	A straight angle is really just a straight line. Two angles that combine to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'. Two angles that combine to form a straight angle are called 'supplementary angles'.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKwdHMiqCg#t=439.19s
Math Antics - Triangles	The one made from the acute angle is called an Acute Triangle, and the one made from the obtuse angle is called an Obtuse Triangle. So that’s simple enough. But notice that for each of our three triangles, the new angles that were formed  when we closed the shapes are all acute angles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLeNaZcy-hE#t=85.1s
Math Antics - Triangles	If we pay close attention  to the length of each side of a triangle, we can see that there are three possibilities. First of all, if all three sides of a triangle are exactly the same length, then we call it an Equilateral Triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLeNaZcy-hE#t=145.06s
Math Antics - Polygons	"And the vertices are points where the sides intersect. And the angles are formed by the intersecting lines. In fact, in Greek, the word polygon literally means ""many-angles."" So all polygons have sides, vertices and angles."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoZhhx_I9s#t=63.66s
Math Antics - Polygons	Flat shapes are also called planar shapes because all of their points are on the same plane. And even though polygons themselves can't be 3D shapes, you can use polygons to make 3D shapes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoZhhx_I9s#t=148.88s
Math Antics - Polygons	Like a box, for example. The box is not a polygon. But each of it's flat sides is a polygon. Alright then. We now have a specific definition of a polygon. A polygon is a multi-sided shape that has  sides, vertices and angles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoZhhx_I9s#t=161.56s
Math Antics - Polygons	"Triangle are so important in geometry, that they'll get a whole video of their own. 4-sided polygons are called quadrilaterals. Wow! Now that's a fancy math word! But it helps if you just remember that the first part, ""quad,"" means ""4."" Quadrilaterals are shapes like squares, rectangles, and parallelograms."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoZhhx_I9s#t=375.58s
Math Antics - Polygons	They'll also get a video of their own. 5-sided polygons are called pentagons. 6-sided polygons are called hexagons. And 8-sided polygons are called octagons. By the way, polygons that have 5, 6, 8, or however many sides like this, are called regular polygons if all of their angles are equal, and irregular polygons if their angles are not equal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoZhhx_I9s#t=397.88s
Math Antics - Mean, Median and Mode	Alright, that’s the Mean. Now what about the Median? The Median is the middle of a data set. It’s the number that splits the data set into two equally sized group or halves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HEzNTGeZ4#t=256.38s
Math Antics - Mean, Median and Mode	Okay, so now you know the difference between Mean and Median. But what about the Mode of a data set?  What in the world does that mean? Well, “Mode” is just a technical word for the value in a data set that occurs most often.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HEzNTGeZ4#t=445.139s
Math Antics - Mean, Median and Mode	Now don’t get confused just because the number 3 was repeater 3 times. The mode is the number that’s repeated most often, NOT how many times it was repeated. As I mentioned, if each member in a data set occurs only once, it had no mode, but it’s also possible for a data set to have more than one mode.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1HEzNTGeZ4#t=484.003s
Math Antics - Basic Probability	Allow me to deliberate. Guilty! Actually, when dealing with probability, a trial (which can also be called an experiment) is a process that has a random outcome …like tossing a coin or rolling dice or spinning a spinner.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzfWUEJjG18#t=263.76s
Math Antics - Basic Probability	We can’t know exactly what will happen, just what will happen on average. So now I have to calculate the average? Well, when we say “on average” we mean that the more trials you do the closer you get to the expected probabilities.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzfWUEJjG18#t=317.17s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	Data, simply put, is information about the world. The type of that data we usually deal with in math is called “quantitive data” because it involves quantities that we represent with numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=19.833s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	Continuous data is data that can have any value in a range. For continuous data, there’s an infinite number of other possible data values in-between any two actual data values. For example, if you ask an ice cream shop, how much ice cream they sold on a hot Saturday afternoon, they might tell you 14 or 15 kg.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=48.967s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	But they could also tell you that it was any number in-between like 14.6 kg, or even 14.625 kg if they can measure that precisely. On the other hand, discrete data is data that can only have specific values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=67.733s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	Continuous data typically comes from a process of measurement, and the values you get are only limited by the precision of the measurement device you’re using. However, discrete data typically comes from the process of counting, which is often limited to specific values like whole numbers or integers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=116.233s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	Organizing data is typically done with a “data table”. Most data tables are made from the intersection of vertical columns and horizontal rows. Each box that’s formed by these intersections is called a “cell” and it can hold a number or other data in it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=166.6s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	But, there’s something that would be even more useful than a data table for answering questions like that, …and that something is called a “graph”. Graphs are visual representations of data. Instead of using rows and columns of numbers, graphs use a variety of visual elements like points, lines, rectangles or other graphics to make a picture of the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=266.7s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	The size of these subdivisions is called the “interval” of that axis. This combination of a minimum value and maximum value and interval form the “scale” of an axis. When making a graph, it’s very important to choose a scale that does a good job of displaying the data in a clear and understandable way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=407.067s
Math Antics - Data And Graphs	A trend is simply a pattern in the data; like increasing, decreasing or staying basically the same. Identifying these sorts of trends in data can be helpful in a couple different ways.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgThf5mv38#t=577.464s
Math Antics - Telling Time	A day is the amount of time it takes the Earth to rotate on its axis one time. So it’s pretty much the fundamental unit of time for our planet. But as important as a day is, we need smaller units of time for planning daily activities, so people decided to divide up each day into 24 equal chunks of time called hours.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU-XUmujbuM#t=43.048s
Math Antics - Telling Time	One of the earliest devices for measuring time was called a sundial. It was basically a flat disc with a triangular pointer in the middle. As the earth rotated, the shadow of the pointer would slowly change position and point to different markings on the edge of the circle, which represented different times of the day.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU-XUmujbuM#t=110.563s
Math Antics - Telling Time	Oh… and the circle itself is often referred to as the “clock face”. A clock is actually kinda complicated, so to see how it works, let’s start with a version that has everything removed except for the second hand and the 60 marks around the edge of the clock face.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU-XUmujbuM#t=187.0s
Math Antics - Units of Distance	As you probably know, distance is a 1-dimensional quantity that describes how far it is between two points. Several different words are used as synonyms for distances, such as “length”, “height”, “width”  or “depth”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKbmvLv-FRo#t=21.918s
Math Antics - Units of Distance	Some are really, really big, while others are so incredibly small that you can’t even see them. This wide ranges of possible sizes is called the relative scale of objects, and it’s helpful to chose a unit of measurement that’s a good match for a particular object’s scale.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKbmvLv-FRo#t=81.714s
Math Antics - Units of Distance	A yard is an English unit of measurement that’s exactly the same as 3 feet placed end-to-end. So a yard is about this long. In general, yards aren’t used as often as feet, but one place where yards are used all the time is in American Football.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKbmvLv-FRo#t=300.591s
Math Antics - Units of Distance	A kilometer is the distance you’d get if you took exactly 1,000 meters and placed them end-to-end. That’s a long distance. It’s much longer than the other metric units we’ve seen. If this is a millimeter, this is a centimeter, and this is a meter …then this is a kilometer! As you can see, a kilometer is in the same scale range as a mile… but a mile is even longer that a kilometer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKbmvLv-FRo#t=508.66s
Math Antics - Intro to the Metric System	Centimeters and Kilograms are examples of what we call “Units of Measurement”. Units of measurements are pre-determined quantities that we use as references and it’s really important to be familiar with common units of measurement so you know what various measurements mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNX-a-5jGeM#t=64.459s
Math Antics - Intro to the Metric System	To get around this problem, the units that we use in math and science are ‘standardized’ which means that they match official standard amounts that can be measured over and over again to give exactly the same result.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNX-a-5jGeM#t=112.599s
Math Antics - Intro to the Metric System	As you can see from our prefixes, the unit that’s 10 times bigger than a meter is called a “dekameter”, the unit that’s 100 times bigger than a meter is called a “hectameter” and the unit that’s 1,000 times bigger than a meter is called a “kilometer” But this system also has prefixes to define units that are smaller than a meter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNX-a-5jGeM#t=232.68s
Math Antics - Intro to the Metric System	The unit that’s 10 times smaller, or one-tenth of a meter, is called a “decimeter” The unit that’s 100 times smaller, or one-hundredth of a meter, is called a “centimeter” and the unit that’s 1,000 times smaller, or one-thousandth of a meter, is called a “millimeter”   Get the idea? There are also abbreviations for each of these units to make writing them down a lot more convenient.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNX-a-5jGeM#t=252.801s
Math Antics - Intro to the Metric System	Mass is a measure of how much actual matter an object contains, which is closely related to its weight on Earth. In the Metric System, the basic unit of mass (or weight) is technically the kilogram, but we’re gonna start with just a plain old ‘gram’ to see how the same prefix pattern we used for length can be used for mass also.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNX-a-5jGeM#t=443.744s
Math Antics - Intro to the Metric System	For reference, a gram is the amount of mass equivalent to one cubic centimeter of water. A “dekagram” is 10 times bigger than a gram. A “hectogram” is 100 times bigger and a “kilogram” is 1,000 times bigger.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNX-a-5jGeM#t=462.62s
Math Antics - Measuring Distance	Uhhh… not that kind of a ruler. In math and science, a ruler is a flat piece of material that has markings on it that correspond to standard units of distance. For example, this ruler has a series of markings that correspond to inches on one side and centimeters on the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNcJ4-JVN5M#t=71.06s
Math Antics - Measuring Distance	You can’t measure the EXACT value of something. There’s always a limit to the accuracy you can achieve based on your measurement device. Accuracy is basically how close a measured value is to the true true value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNcJ4-JVN5M#t=249.72s
Math Antics - Measuring Distance	See what I did there? Last of all, I want to briefly introduce you to some low-tech devices that are commonly used to measure longer distances. For example, a tape measure is sort of a long flexible ruler that can be wound up on a spool to make it more compact.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNcJ4-JVN5M#t=574.88s
Algebra Basics: What Are Polynomials? - Math Antics	In Algebra, terms are mathematical expressions that are made up of two different parts: a number part and a variable part. In a term, the number part and the variable part are multiplied together, but since multiplication is implied in Algebra, the two parts of a term are usually written right next to each other with no times symbol between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU#t=22.963s
Algebra Basics: What Are Polynomials? - Math Antics	A polynomial is a combination of many terms. It’s kind of like a chain of terms that are all linked together using addition or subtraction. The terms themselves contain multiplication, but each term in a polynomial must be joined by either addition or subtraction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU#t=147.372s
Algebra Basics: What Are Polynomials? - Math Antics	And polynomials can be made from any number of terms joined together, but there are a few specific names that are used to describe polynomials with a certain number of terms. If there’s only one term (which isn’t really a chain) then we call it a “monomial” because the prefix “mono” means “one”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU#t=164.212s
Algebra Basics: What Are Polynomials? - Math Antics	If a polynomial contains a 4th degree term (but no higher terms), then it’s called a “4th degree” polynomial. But if its highest term is only a 2nd degree term, then it’s called a “2nd degree” polynomial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffLLmV4mZwU#t=424.421s
Algebra Basics: Simplifying Polynomials - Math Antics	‘Like’ terms are terms that have exactly the same variable part. But… why can we combine them? Well to understand that, I like to pretend that the variable parts of a polynomial’s terms are fruit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKC74YKJpNY#t=166.706s
Algebra Basics: Laws Of Exponents - Math Antics	And if you think about it, that kinda makes sense. A negative number is the ‘inverse’ of its positive counterpart, and division is the inverse operation of multiplication, right? So a negative exponent is basically repeated division.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkhPRz7Hocg#t=127.041s
Math Antics - Negative Numbers	To learn what negative numbers are, we first need to start with ‘whole numbers’. You remember what whole numbers are, right? They’re the set of numbers on the number line, starting with zero, and then counting up one at a time: 1, 2, 3, 4… all the way to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAoLCXpao6s#t=17.48s
Math Antics - Negative Numbers	And zero is the special number that separates the positive numbers from the negative numbers. By the way, when you combine all these numbers (1 ,2, 3, and so on up to infinity, and -1, -2, -3, and so on down to negative infinity, and the number zero) that entire set of numbers gets a special name in math.  They’re called ‘the Integers’.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAoLCXpao6s#t=60.538s
Math Antics - Adding Mixed Numbers	As you remember, a Mixed Number is a combination (or sum) of a Whole Number and a Proper Fraction. And for this lesson, it’s gonna be important to remember that even though the plus symbol isn’t usually shown between those two parts of a Mixed Number, they’re being ADDED together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pynfj2bYRms#t=17.439s
Math Antics - Mixed Numbers	But now, what if we get a little crazy and add one more fourth? Now we have FIVE-fourths and we’ve gone past 1 on the number line. Five-fourths (or 5 over 4) is what we call an Improper Fraction because the Numerator (the top number) is greater than the Denominator (the bottom number).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2oP6FZ6HA#t=147.294s
Algebra Basics: What Are Functions? - Math Antics	A function is something that takes each value from an input set and relates it (or maps it) to a value in an output set. And you’ll often hear these input and output sets referred to by special math names.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52tpYl2tTqk#t=76.888s
Algebra Basics: What Are Functions? - Math Antics	The input set is usually called “The Domain” and the output set is usually called “The Range”. And it’s really common to see some or all of a function’s inputs and outputs listed in what we call a “function table”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52tpYl2tTqk#t=87.675s
Algebra Basics: What Are Functions? - Math Antics	f(5) = 17, and f(6) = 20 Pretty easy, huh? Alright, so that’s what functions are in math. They’re things that relate an input value to exactly one output value. And the set of all input values is called the domain while the set of output values is usually called the range.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52tpYl2tTqk#t=648.184s
Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics	What we have now is a “number plane”. It’s basically like a 2-Dimensional version of a number line, but that second dimension makes it much more useful. With a simple 1-Dimensional number line, we could show where various numbers were located along that line by drawing (or plotting) points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uc62CuQjc4#t=117.174s
Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics	The quadrants are named 1 through 4 so we can easily refer to them in conversations if we need to. Quadrant 1 is the upper right quadrant, and it contains all of the points where both the X and Y values are positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uc62CuQjc4#t=514.565s
Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics	And Quadrant 4 is the lower right, and it contains all of the points that have a positive X value and a negative Y value. Roman Numerals are usually used to label the four quadrants and they’re in that order because that’s the order you would encounter the quadrants if you started with a line segment from the origin to the coordinate (1,0) and then rotated that line counter-clockwise around the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uc62CuQjc4#t=543.009s
Algebra Basics: Inequalities In Algebra - Math Antics	Ah! …that’s why it’s called a “test point”. The point that you choose can either pass or fail the test. In this case, since plugging the point’s x and y values into the inequality gave us a false result, that means that the point is NOT a valid answer for the inequality.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyesLifeUBw#t=526.545s
Math Antics - The Pythagorean Theorem	And you need to know which angle is the right angle because it helps you identify an important side of the triangle called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and it’s always the side that’s ‘opposite’ of the right angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqhlG3Vakw8#t=128.707s
Math Antics - The Pythagorean Theorem	’c’ is the length of the hypotenuse side. The other two sides of the triangle (the ones that DO touch or form the right angle) are called its “legs”. Our Pythagorean Theorem definition uses the variable names ‘a’ and ‘b’ to represent their lengths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqhlG3Vakw8#t=154.767s
Math Antics - The Pythagorean Theorem	So this blue area represent ‘b squared' in the Pythagorean Theorem. And finally, let’s deal with the hypotenuse, or “side c”, which is the longest side. It’s 5 units long. Squaring 5 means multiplying 5 times 5 which is 25, and the geometric equivalent is a 5 by 5 square that has an area of 25 units.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqhlG3Vakw8#t=287.994s
Math Antics - The Pythagorean Theorem	No problemo! The Pythagorean Theorem tells us the relationship between all three sides of ANY right triangle, so we can figure it out. We know that 'a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared' so let’s plug what we DO know into that equation and then solve it for what we DON’T know.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqhlG3Vakw8#t=383.461s
Math Antics - Volume	It forms a 3-Dimensional object that’s called a cube. And to measure a 3-Dimensional object like this, we use the 3-Dimensional quantity called volume. Volume tells us how much 3-Dimensional space (or 3D space) an object occupies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwecTgce6c#t=84.808s
Math Antics - Volume	Surface area is a lot like it sounds… it’s the area of the object’s outer surface or shell. Perimeter and surface area are both outer boundaries of geometric shapes. Perimeter is the 1-Dimensional outer boundary of a 2-Dimensional shape, and surface area is the 2-Dimensional outer boundary of a 3-Dimensional shape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwecTgce6c#t=234.345s
Math Antics - Volume	And if you start with a circle, and extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape called a “cylinder”. From the others, you might have thought it should be called a “circular prism” but technically prisms are shapes that are formed by extending a polygon, and since a circle is not a polygon, the resulting shape is not called a prism.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwecTgce6c#t=352.24s
Math Antics - Perimeter	Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we’re going to learn about an important concept in Geometry called Perimeter. “Perimeter” is just a fancy math term that means the distance (or length) around a shape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAY1bsazcgM#t=6.867s
Math Antics - Perimeter	And that’s the end of this lesson. We’ve learned that Perimeter is the distance (or length) around a geometric shape, and we’ve learned how to calculate it for any polygon. You just add up the lengths of all the sides and the total length is the perimeter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAY1bsazcgM#t=419.2s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	Since the invention of the wheel, circles have been extremely important to all humanity. Grog make wheel. Thanks Grog! In fact, you probably see circles  almost everywhere you turn… But mathematically, what is a circle? Well in Geometry, a circle is defined as: the set of all points that are equidistant (or the same distance) from another single point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=17.306s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	That's why a circle is defined as the set of points that are equidistant from a center point. But of course, we usually don't see it as a set of points because there are infinitely many of them, so they form a continuous circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=85.597s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	Okay, now let's learn about the  parts that make up a circle. First of all we have  the original point that we started with. That's called the center, or the origin of the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=99.267s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	Another important circle dimension is called the diameter. The diameter is the distance across a circle. If you start at one point on the circle and then draw a line straight through the center to the other side, that distance is the diameter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=139.197s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	It's called the circumference. The circumference is the distance  all the way around a circle. We're going to learn how to calculate the circumference of any circle in the next video.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=182.43s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	But basically, a ratio is just a relationship between two numbers that is written like a fraction. Pi is the ratio of two different distances on a circle. It's the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across a circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=243.768s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	An irrational number has decimal digits  that never end and never repeat. Grog confused. Yes, 'irrational' numbers are confusing, but seeing some more of Pi's decimal digits  will help you understand what I mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=357.286s
Math Antics - Circles, What Is PI?	We've also learned about  a very special number called Pi. Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and its value is about 3.14  no matter what size the circle is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0fZ_lkFpQ#t=435.5s
Math Antic - Simplifying Square Roots	That seems even more complicated to me!! Yeah, I know what you mean. Sometimes it’s hard for people to decide what the ‘simplest’ or most helpful form is, so mathematicians rely on what are called “conventions” where they all agree on a ‘preferred’ way to express things.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mejAHKMBiM#t=178.9s
Math Antic - Simplifying Square Roots	The square root of 2 can’t be simplified, but many mathematicians like to avoid having roots in the denominator, especially when those roots are irrational numbers. So, if your teacher asked you to re-write this fraction without a root in the denominator, how would you do it? Well, think back to when you learned how to add or subtract ‘unlike’ fractions, which means fractions that don’t have the same denominator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mejAHKMBiM#t=566.652s
Math Antics - Intro To Exponents (aka Indices)	And it’s written full size and it’s called the “base”. The second number tells us how many copies of the base to multiply together. It’s written much smaller and up at the top of the line like this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zUmvpkhvW8#t=136.61s
Math Antics - Intro To Exponents (aka Indices)	Okay, so now you know that exponents are a way of showing repeated multiplication, and you also know what the two numbers in an exponent mean. The base is the number that will get repeatedly multiplied together, and the exponent (or index) tells us how many times to repeat it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zUmvpkhvW8#t=569.36s
Math Antics - Exponents and Square Roots	That’s kind of a strange name for a math operation, but it will make more sense in just a minute. First, let’s review what we mean by inverse operations. In the video called “What Is Arithmetic”, we learned that inverse operations are pairs of math operations that UNDO each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4zejSI8zho#t=24.379s
Math Antics - Exponents and Square Roots	And do you remember what that part of the original exponent is called? Yep, it’s called the “base”. So doing a root operation is going to give us the base as our answer, and that helps us understand its name a little better.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4zejSI8zho#t=95.784s
Math Antics - Exponents and Square Roots	…so common in fact, that they even had special names. Raising a number to the 2nd power was called “squaring” it, and raising a number to the 3rd power was called “cubing” it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4zejSI8zho#t=475.906s
Math Antics - Simplifying Fractions	And then you see if there’s any factors that are the same on the top and bottom. We call those “common factors”.  And if there are, you just cancel them out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBUQH8Tkqc#t=255.615s
Math Antics - Common Denominator ECD	But often you’ll be asked to add or subtract fractions that have different bottom numbers, or ‘unlike’ fractions. And we learned that the only way we can do that is to change our fractions so that they DO have the same bottom number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Y0Kvcnw8g#t=16.94s
Math Antics - Common Denominator ECD	Alright then… how do we do that? How can we change two ‘unlike’ fractions into two ‘like’ fractions? How do we get our fractions to have a ‘common denominator’? The answer is, we need to use equivalent fractions! You remember what equivalent fractions are, right? They’re fractions that have the same value, but use different top and bottom numbers: like 1 over 2 and 2 over 4. They both represent one half, but with different numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Y0Kvcnw8g#t=28.844s
Math Antics - Basic Division	Like if you had 9 cookies and 4 kids, each kid could have 2 cookies but there would be 1 left over. And in division, that left over amount is called a “remainder”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGMf314LUc0#t=75.731s
Math Antics - Basic Division	The answer to a division problem is called the “quotient”. The answer tells us how many we will end up with in each group. So whenever you have a complicated division problem to do, the first step is to re-write your problem in this form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGMf314LUc0#t=166.896s
Math Antics - Division With Partial Quotients	We just need to finalize our answer by combining the answers we got along the way. And we need to combine them because they were just ‘partial answers’, or ‘partial quotients’. Get it?  “Quotient” is just the fancy name for the answer to a division problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2XsYU0o8M#t=233.826s
Derivatives of Logarithmic and Exponential Functions	First let’s recall that the natural log is the logarithm with base e. As it happens, the derivative of the natural log of x is equal to one over x. From this, we can also know the derivative of the log of x with some base a.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjKMkbcbtHY#t=44.68s
Integration By Parts	Let’s quickly recall the product rule. It says that the derivative of a product of two functions is equal to the first times the derivative of the second, plus the derivative of the first times the second. Well we know that we can always go backwards by integrating, so the integral of this derivative must be the product of the two functions that we started with. Now let’s work with this expression a little bit to get something more useful.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNU8iK8sGD0#t=39.829s
Graphing Functions and Their Derivatives	This is the fact that the value of a function and the rate of change of that function are totally unrelated. Let’s say we have this function here, a parabola that opens downwards, with its vertex at the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIY86WqvGjw#t=39.02s
Graphing Functions and Their Derivatives	And lastly, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and therefore the second derivative of position, and because of this, the acceleration graph makes sense too. The acceleration experienced by the ball is just the acceleration due to the gravitational pull of the earth, and that is a constant negative value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIY86WqvGjw#t=316.78s
Graphing Functions and Their Derivatives	Any time the second derivative is equal to zero, this will correspond to an inflection point. This is a point where a function changes from concave up to concave down, or vice versa.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIY86WqvGjw#t=473.15s
Graphing Functions and Their Derivatives	Now, how can we get the information we need? Well let’s recall that finding the zeros of the first derivative will give us any maxima and minima, since these are points on the function where the tangent line has a slope of zero, meaning a horizontal line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIY86WqvGjw#t=534.3s
Polar Coordinates and Graphing Polar Equations	What is X in terms of R and theta? Well, cosine theta is X over R, so X is R cosine theta. What is Y in terms of R and theta? Sine theta is Y over R, so Y is R sine theta.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwLUapqnwkk#t=322.49s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 1: Types, Calculating Surface Area	A polyhedron is a three-dimensional object with flat surfaces called faces, and each face of a polyhedron is a polygon. Where two faces meet and share a side, this is called an edge, and any point where three or more edges meet is called a vertex.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAd3Eo25Bbg#t=51.44s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 1: Types, Calculating Surface Area	The first type of polyhedron we will look at is the prism. This is a shape with two congruent parallel bases of some type of polygon, and all the other shapes are parallelograms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAd3Eo25Bbg#t=72.71s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 1: Types, Calculating Surface Area	A prism is named for the shape of its bases. This is a rectangular prism. We can see the bases, and all the rectangular sides, which qualify as parallelograms. We can have pentagonal and hexagonal prisms as well, we just have parallel bases of the shape that is referenced, and then as many rectangles connecting the two bases as are necessary.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAd3Eo25Bbg#t=85.59s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 1: Types, Calculating Surface Area	A pyramid is named for the shape of its base. This is a square pyramid. This is a triangular pyramid. And we could certainly have pyramid bases with more sides than this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAd3Eo25Bbg#t=144.04s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 1: Types, Calculating Surface Area	This is called the surface area, quite literally the area on the surface of a three-dimensional shape, which we can think of as the amount of wrapping paper we would need to wrap up a gift of a particular shape, just barely covering all of it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAd3Eo25Bbg#t=183.69s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 1: Types, Calculating Surface Area	Lastly, let’s find the surface area of a sphere, which is the set of all points in space that are a fixed distance from a central point, with that distance being the radius of the sphere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAd3Eo25Bbg#t=354.97s
Formulas for Trigonometric Functions: Sum/Difference, Double/Half-Angle, Prod-to-Sum/Sum-to-Prod	Then, we can take the square root of both sides, and on the left we just get sine, cosine, and tangent of X over two. These are called half-angle formulas. They allow us to evaluate trig functions for smaller angles in terms of bigger ones with known values, and these plus or minus signs before the radical just mean that we have to look at the quadrant we are in to assign positive or negative values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cB4MLhaCk0#t=353.419s
Formulas for Trigonometric Functions: Sum/Difference, Double/Half-Angle, Prod-to-Sum/Sum-to-Prod	For product-to-sum formulas, each term on the left is the product of two trig functions involving two different angles. On the right we have trig functions involving sums and differences. As we said, there are also sum-to-product formulas, where the sum or difference of two trig functions is expressed as a product.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cB4MLhaCk0#t=450.009s
What are the Types of Numbers? Real vs. Imaginary, Rational vs. Irrational	However, in another sense, we can take the square root of a negative number if we admit that the result is imaginary. While the square root of one is simply one, we will say that the square root of negative one is I.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUGmwPwtbpg#t=67.49s
What are the Types of Numbers? Real vs. Imaginary, Rational vs. Irrational	But what could these numbers be? Irrational numbers are ones that have non-repeating decimals that are nonterminating, meaning they continue forever with no pattern. The square root of two is such a number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUGmwPwtbpg#t=161.51s
What are the Types of Numbers? Real vs. Imaginary, Rational vs. Irrational	Other irrational numbers include pi, which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. We all probably know the first few digits of pi, which are three point one four one five nine, yadda yadda yadda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUGmwPwtbpg#t=284.49s
What are the Types of Numbers? Real vs. Imaginary, Rational vs. Irrational	If we want to, we can subdivide rational numbers further to describe types of numbers we already know about, like fractions and integers. Fractions are all the numbers that happen in between the integers, and there are infinitely many of them in between each integer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUGmwPwtbpg#t=423.61s
What are the Types of Numbers? Real vs. Imaginary, Rational vs. Irrational	Within integers, we can describe whole numbers, which are all the integers starting from zero and going in the positive direction, and natural numbers, which are all the integers starting from one, so the same as whole numbers just without the zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUGmwPwtbpg#t=442.289s
Calculating the Area of Shapes	Professor Dave here, let’s learn to calculate area. Once we know how to calculate one-dimensional lengths like perimeters and diameters, it is time to learn how to calculate two-dimensional areas. This is the amount of surface that a figure covers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zzV2DV19IU#t=0.14s
Proving Triangle Congruence and Similarity	We can also prove triangle congruence through different methods. First, there is the side side side theorem. This states that if the three sides of a triangle are identical to the three sides of the other triangle, they must be congruent, because there is only one way for three sides of particular lengths to come together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ4Ms6SXEgg#t=103.93s
Understanding Matrices and Matrix Notation	Since the variables are all the same, it is the coefficients that are relevant, so why don’t we abbreviate these coefficients some other way? We can set up a matrix. A matrix is an array of numbers contained in brackets.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6bVhgmy2rw#t=44.47s
Understanding Matrices and Matrix Notation	So there we have it. A three by four matrix, meaning a matrix with three rows and four columns, that contains all of the information that was contained in the system of linear equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6bVhgmy2rw#t=107.2s
Set Theory: Types of Sets, Unions and Intersections	These solutions use interval notation. We could have an open interval, which would be the set of all numbers in between A and B. We could have a closed interval, which would be the set of all numbers between A and B and including A and B themselves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JkCmZAQaio#t=70.44s
Set Theory: Types of Sets, Unions and Intersections	Intervals that include positive or negative infinity are called infinite intervals. We can also have sets that are not continuous intervals, but rather just collections of elements. These utilize this other type of bracket, and they just list all of the elements that are included in the set, separated by commas.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JkCmZAQaio#t=88.61s
Set Theory: Types of Sets, Unions and Intersections	Remember, this isn’t zero, because zero is an element that could be included in a set. The null set means there is nothing in it, not even zero. As we said, we can use interval notation to represent the solutions of inequalities, and sometimes we will need unions and intersections to do this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JkCmZAQaio#t=217.95s
Basic Number Properties for Algebra	Changing the way these are grouped will not matter if we are doing addition or multiplication. To be thorough, let’s also mention some pretty intuitive properties like the additive identity property. This says that you can add or subtract zero to any number or algebraic term, and it will retain its identity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZ2GcCTtCA#t=210.98s
Basic Number Properties for Algebra	Any number or algebraic term times one will give you the same term again. Four X times one is four X. And lastly, the inverse property of addition says that anything plus its additive inverse equals zero, so X plus negative X equals zero, and the inverse property of multiplication says that anything times its multiplicative inverse equals one, so X times one over X equals one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bZ2GcCTtCA#t=248.75s
Graphing Algebraic Functions: Domain and Range, Maxima and Minima	If the exponent is even, it is an even function, and it will somewhat resemble the X squared function. Another thing we must frequently describe is the domain of a function. As we mentioned before, this is the set of all allowed X values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjsQWKq-dGQ#t=158.88s
Graphing Algebraic Functions: Domain and Range, Maxima and Minima	Beyond these parameters, we can identify relative maxima and minima of a function, which are the hills and valleys. A relative maximum is a point where the function changes from increasing to decreasing, and a relative minimum is a point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjsQWKq-dGQ#t=265.419s
Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors	Eigenvectors are vectors that have a special relationship with matrix A, such that when you multiply A times the eigenvector x, you get back that same vector, multiplied by a scalar, lambda.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvxWaQnrqI#t=51.239s
Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors	To avoid this situation, (A - λI) can’t be invertible, and therefore, as we recall from learning about inverse matrices, the determinant of this matrix must be zero. The determinant of A - λI will form a polynomial in λ often referred to as the “characteristic polynomial”, and the equation formed when the determinant equals zero is called the “characteristic equation”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvxWaQnrqI#t=247.36s
The Divergence Theorem	Professor Dave again, let’s talk about the Divergence Theorem. Green’s Theorem  gave us an additional method for calculating a line integral around a closed curve. Now we will introduce an additional method of calculating the surface integral for a “closed” surface S. By this we mean that we have some solid region in space, and its boundary will be our surface. Recall that the surface integral for this will be expressed as the surface integral over S, of F dot n dS, where F is some vector field permeating space, and n is the normal vector of the surface. The divergence theorem, also called Gauss’s Theorem, states that this surface integral is equal to the triple integral over the solid region of the divergence of F dV. Here, dV is our differential volume, which in cartesian x, y, z coordinates will simply be dx dy dz.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGvgru4TwE#t=0.4s
Introduction to Linear Algebra: Systems of Linear Equations	Linear equations are a very basic kind of equation, which take the form Y equals MX plus B. We learned many things about linear equations when we studied algebra, and we will assume that this information is already known, so if at any point you feel you need a refresher, go back to that portion of the series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csgNflj69-Y#t=68.97s
Introduction to Linear Algebra: Systems of Linear Equations	M two is the cost of orange juice per gallon, and X two is the number of gallons of orange juice we get. Y one is the amount of money we have, and so Y one will equal M one X one plus M two X two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csgNflj69-Y#t=203.19s
Introduction to Linear Algebra: Systems of Linear Equations	From now on, we will consider a linear equation to be any equation in the form A one X one, plus A two X two, plus A three X three, all the way to ANXN, equals B. So as we can see from the ellipses, there can be any number of terms of this type, depending on the value of N, and their sum will equal some constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csgNflj69-Y#t=311.3s
Introduction to Linear Algebra: Systems of Linear Equations	When a system has at least one solution, we say the system is consistent, and when a system has no solution, we say that the system is inconsistent. But we don’t have to stop with two dimensions, corresponding to two variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csgNflj69-Y#t=509.51s
The Mean Value Theorem For Integrals: Average Value of a Function	Now that we’ve covered differentiation, let’s get back to integration. The mean value theorem for integration allows us to compute the average value of a function over some interval from A to B in the following manner.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56-JCZIkDVU#t=173.08s
Vector Fields, Divergence, and Curl	But now we are going to introduce vector fields, which can be thought of as functions that take in coordinates and give back vectors. These vector fields will end up having vectors assigned to every point throughout the coordinate system, as shown here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qxxd68fZng#t=33.12s
Vector Fields, Divergence, and Curl	Recall that del is a vector made of the differential operators  or if in three dimensions . The gradient of some function f, del f, is itself a vector field with components being the partial derivatives of the function, so .	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qxxd68fZng#t=263.75s
Vector Fields, Divergence, and Curl	To get more specific, if we have a vector field F, and it can be written as the gradient of a function f, the vector field is called a “conservative vector field” and the function f is called a “potential function” for the vector field F.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qxxd68fZng#t=287.509s
Vector Fields, Divergence, and Curl	This is the curl of our vector field. Notice that the result is also a vector field. So while the divergence gives a scalar field, the curl gives a vector field. The curl represents the rotation of a vector field F, the direction of the curl being the axis of rotation and the magnitude of the curl being the magnitude of rotation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qxxd68fZng#t=602.019s
The Gram-Schmidt Process	These are the orthonormal basis vectors we obtain from our original basis, thanks to the Gram-Schmidt Process. Being able to generate an orthonormal basis is a useful tool, as the bases themselves can be very helpful for certain calculations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHbfZWZJTGc#t=508.04s
Complex, Hermitian, and Unitary Matrices	Professor Dave here, let’s look at complex matrices. Up until now, we’ve been focusing a lot on real matrices, that is, matrices where all of the entries are real numbers. Now it’s time to consider complex matrices, which are matrices in which some of the entries contain complex numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUuTx2nbizM#t=0.4s
Complex, Hermitian, and Unitary Matrices	If you need a little review regarding comlex numbers, what they are and relevant operations, check out this tutorial from earlier in the series. Otherwise, let’s dive right in. We can simply recall that complex numbers are numbers with a real part, a, and an imaginary part, bi, where i is the square root of -1, and as we said, we can find complex numbers in matrices.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUuTx2nbizM#t=26.289s
Complex, Hermitian, and Unitary Matrices	Now that we understand the conjugate transpose, let’s look at a special type of matrix called Hermitian matrices. These are square matrices whose conjugate transpose is the same as the original matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUuTx2nbizM#t=301.379s
The Law of Sines	As it happens, there is a law that will help us find the sides and angles of oblique triangles, as well. Oblique triangles are ones that don’t have a right angle. For these, all the SOHCAHTOA stuff we learned won’t work anymore.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmfO1YgzmHI#t=21.599s
The Law of Sines	But there are other relationships we can use, and one of them is called the law of sines. This law says that for an oblique triangle with angles A, B, and C, all capitalized, as well as sides A, B, and C, all lower case, where the sides are precisely opposite their corresponding angles, the relationship between all of these will be A over sine A equals B over sine B equals C over sine C.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmfO1YgzmHI#t=36.24s
Graphing Parallel and Perpendicular Lines	First, let’s take a look at a graph containing two parallel lines. These are lines in the same plane that never intersect. In order for this to be the case, the lines must have the same ratio of vertical change to horizontal change.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oe-GqFrYFU#t=18.41s
Graphing Higher-Degree Polynomials: The Leading Coefficient Test and Finding Zeros	There are several possibilities for the end behavior of polynomial functions, which means what it does as X goes to positive or negative infinity, so let’s start by learning how to figure out what the end behavior of a function will be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHEtGgTexHI#t=63.06s
Graphing Higher-Degree Polynomials: The Leading Coefficient Test and Finding Zeros	We can do this by using something called the leading coefficient test. We look at the leading term in a polynomial, or the term with the largest exponent, and we look at its exponent and coefficient.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHEtGgTexHI#t=78.11s
Introduction to Geometry: Ancient Greece and the Pythagoreans	In this way, mathematics came to be defined as the field of inquiry in which all questions have completely objective answers. The sum of two angles, the ratio of side lengths on a triangle, these are values that can be firmly arrived at and are completely inarguable, just like the solutions of polynomials that we studied in basic algebra.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THtc8pDU7J8#t=83.53s
Introduction to Geometry: Ancient Greece and the Pythagoreans	The planets are distributed about the solar system more or less at random, just like every other planetary system we can see in our galaxy. But their contributions to math have stuck around, and between the work of Pythagoras and other great mathematicians like Euclid, mankind’s ability to describe the universe was dramatically transformed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THtc8pDU7J8#t=162.919s
Sequences, Factorials, and Summation Notation	And then nine, eleven, thirteen. Sequences like this are called arithmetic sequences, because each term differs from the previous by a constant amount, in this case by two. But not all sequences work this way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DPkqpmm1sI#t=95.92s
Sequences, Factorials, and Summation Notation	If a sequence has a domain that includes all positive integers, meaning that starting from one you can keep plugging in numbers all the way to infinity, this is called an infinite sequence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DPkqpmm1sI#t=162.54s
Sequences, Factorials, and Summation Notation	A famous one of these is called the Fibonacci sequence. This one starts with a one, and then another one, and then every term after that is the sum of the previous two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DPkqpmm1sI#t=196.73s
Sequences, Factorials, and Summation Notation	Factorials are similar to exponents, in that they only operate on the number they directly follow. This is an important concept to understand, as we will frequently see factorials in sequences. Say we have three over N plus one factorial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DPkqpmm1sI#t=289.92s
Sequences, Factorials, and Summation Notation	Summation notation takes a sequence and then instructs you to find the sum of a certain number of terms in that sequence. For example, let’s just start with this first sequence we looked at, with the natural numbers, but instead of A sub N, let’s write A sub I, since this is a slightly different application, although technically we could use any letter here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DPkqpmm1sI#t=325.18s
Power Series	Professor Dave here, let’s check out power series. We’ve seen a few different types of series up until this point, so let’s check out another. A power series is one that takes the form C sub N times X to the N power, from zero to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxVBT83x8oc#t=0.5s
Power Series	We can also describe the interval of convergence as the interval describing all the values of X for which the series converges. Let’s try an example and see how this applies. Take X to the N, over N factorial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxVBT83x8oc#t=257.359s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	But it also has a direction, meaning five of something in a particular direction. This is why we represent a vector with an arrow. The length of the vector tells us the magnitude, so a longer vector means a greater magnitude, and the direction the arrow points, relative to some axes, tells us the direction of the vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=36.34s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	Many vectors are simply displacement vectors, denoting how far an object has traveled and in which direction. If such a vector connects two points, like A and B, we can call this vector AB with a little arrow over it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=83.32s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	So there are a number of ways to represent vector addition geometrically. We can also perform multiplication with vectors. The simplest way to do this is called scalar multiplication. This is when a vector is multiplied by a scalar, which is just a number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=174.9s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	The same can be said for vector subtraction, we just subtract the corresponding components. In fact, let’s quickly mention some important properties of vectors. The commutative and associative properties of addition apply to vectors, like the way that A plus B equals B plus A, and the way that A plus the quantity B plus C equals the quantity A plus B, plus C. Any vector plus the zero vector, which is the vector with zeros for all its components, will simply give the same vector we started with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=359.38s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	Any vector plus the negative version of that same vector, which is simply a vector minus itself, is the zero vector. While we can’t add a vector and scalar, a scalar can be distributed across a sum of vectors, and a vector can be distributed across a sum of scalars.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=394.01s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	Those are the important properties we should understand. There is one other way we can represent vectors that will be important to know, and it involves standard basis vectors, which are unit vectors, meaning they have a length of one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=425.53s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	If we are in a three-dimensional coordinate system, any any vector can be represented by three components. The vector with the components one, zero, zero, extending one unit along the X-axis, is denoted by a lower case I.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=441.58s
Introduction to Vectors and Their Operations	The vector with components zero, one, zero, extending one unit along the Y-axis, is denoted by a lower case J. And zero, zero, one, extending one unit along the Z-axis, is denoted by a lower case K.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBSCMTYaH1s#t=457.0s
Evaluating Line Integrals	We will be integrating along small segments of the curve C, which we will call ds. Just like when we initially learned integration, these segments will be our widths, while the surface f(x,y) will be our heights.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz14rC0XvHI#t=37.28s
Evaluating Line Integrals	As we have learned in a previous tutorial, x of t and y of t are referred to as parametric equations, and as t varies, the x and y coordinates of the curve they form will be mapped out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz14rC0XvHI#t=122.829s
Alternating Series, Types of Convergence, and the Ratio Test	It’s Professor Dave, let’s look at alternating series. We’ve examined arithmetic sequences and geometric series, so let’s look at another type of series now. An alternating series is one in which the signs of the terms in the series alternate between positive and negative values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Md4CEW0-zM#t=0.38s
Alternating Series, Types of Convergence, and the Ratio Test	So now we know how to look at alternating series and test for convergence, but we must now describe two different types of convergence. Let’s say we have some series, A sub N, from one to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Md4CEW0-zM#t=344.83s
Alternating Series, Types of Convergence, and the Ratio Test	Now let’s take the absolute value of that series, which means we are taking the absolute value of every term in that series. If A sub N is convergent, and the absolute value of A sub N is also convergent, then that series is called absolutely convergent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Md4CEW0-zM#t=358.62s
Alternating Series, Types of Convergence, and the Ratio Test	Taking our first example, negative one to the N minus one, over N squared, we said that this series was convergent. Now let’s take the absolute value of this series. This means that whenever the negative one gives us a negative value for a particular term in the series, we just make it positive instead, so rather than an alternating series, we just get a regular p-series with a P value of two, as though the negative one term was not present.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Md4CEW0-zM#t=381.5s
Alternating Series, Types of Convergence, and the Ratio Test	However, when we take the absolute value of this series, which turns all the terms positive, we get another p-series, but this time with a P value of one. Any p-series with a P value of one or less will be divergent, and so we say that the original series is conditionally convergent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Md4CEW0-zM#t=441.98s
Taylor and Maclaurin Series	It’s Professor Dave, let’s learn about Taylor and Maclaurin series. In the previous tutorial, we talked about power series. These were series in the following form, C sub N times X to the N, from zero to infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a58otkmkHtk#t=0.54s
Taylor and Maclaurin Series	Now that we understand differentiation, we are ready to expand our understanding of this kind of series, so let’s talk about this now. Say we are looking at this power expansion, the series C sub N times the quantity X minus A, raised to the N power.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a58otkmkHtk#t=33.34s
Subspaces and Span	Professor Dave here, let’s talk subspaces. Once we understand what makes up a vector space, it is fairly easy to understand the concept of subspaces as well. To put it simply, a subspace is a smaller set within a vector space that is itself a vector space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM4TDL9Hj8U#t=0.48s
Subspaces and Span	Any sum of these elements multiplied by some scalars, which we can represent as a1v1 plus a2v2 and so on, up to anvn is called a linear combination. The set of all possible linear combinations of these elements is called their span.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM4TDL9Hj8U#t=199.69s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 1: Circles	So these are called conic sections because they are literally different cross sections of a cone. We can also describe these using a parameter called eccentricity, which is a term that describes how much a conic section deviates from being perfectly circular.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUvo3GrgWHk#t=59.079s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 1: Circles	As we know, circles are defined as the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point, which we refer to as the center of the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUvo3GrgWHk#t=96.65s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 1: Circles	This distance from the center to any point in the circle is called the radius of the circle. If we place the circle in the coordinate plane, we could say that any point on the circle has coordinates of XY, because any point on the circle contains X and Y values that satisfy the conditions of the circle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUvo3GrgWHk#t=107.689s
Basis and Dimension	To put it as simply as possible, a basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that can be used as building blocks to make any other vector in the vector space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C9GKyfUQkc#t=26.39s
Order of Arithmetic Operations: PEMDAS	This convention for the correct order of operations is called PEMDAS. It stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. This tells us the order that we do things, from left to right.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_f7c3ztFrI#t=77.36s
Evaluating Indefinite Integrals	These are called indefinite integrals. The main difference is that definite integrals are numbers, like the area under a curve for a specific interval. But indefinite integrals, because there is no specified interval over which to evaluate, are actually functions, or families of functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xHA2RjVkwY#t=22.52s
Evaluating Indefinite Integrals	As we said, indefinite integrals are ones with no limits of integration indicated. This means that it won’t be evaluated to get a number, but rather we are integrating some function, f of x, to find some new function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xHA2RjVkwY#t=97.36s
Evaluating Indefinite Integrals	So a definite integral is a number. An indefinite integral will not be a number, but rather a function, the antiderivative of the integrand, with the constant C listed so that this function represents all the possible antiderivatives.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xHA2RjVkwY#t=553.82s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	It’s Professor Dave, let’s talk about circles. We’ve been talking about polygons for a while, which are shapes made of line segments. There are plenty of other shapes to talk about where the edges are not straight lines, but are curved in some way.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=0.44s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	The simplest of these shapes, or really, the simplest of all shapes, is the circle. A circle is simply the set of all points that are a particular fixed distance from some central point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=21.59s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	If we draw all the points in this plane that are five centimeters away from this central point, we get a circle. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle, and any line segment connecting the center and some point on the circle can be referred to as a radius.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=52.62s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	Other line segments of note include chords, which are line segments with both endpoints on the circle. A chord that passes through the center of the circle is called a diameter, and we will note that the length of any diameter of a circle is always exactly twice the length of its radius.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=75.48s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	Lastly, any part of a circle defined by two endpoints is called an arc. If this arc becomes the whole circle, which represents the distance around the circle, or the perimeter of the circle, this is called the circumference.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=96.42s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	This is an irrational number, which as we discussed before, is a number that can’t be expressed as the ratio of two fractions. This means that it has a decimal representation with digits that go on forever, without any kind of repeating pattern.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=127.08s
Circles: Radius, Diameter, Chords, Circumference, and Sectors	A sector is a part of a circle enclosed by two radii and the arc that connects them, like a slice of pizza. Within this sector there is a central angle, and the angles of all the sectors in a circle will always add up to three hundred sixty, or one full revolution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBIv5-7RbQY#t=209.79s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 4: Hyperbolas	Professor Dave here, let’s graph some hyperbolas. We’ve made it to the last conic section, the hyperbola. This is the one that extends through the base of one side of the cone all the way through to the base of the other side of the cone, producing something that at first looks kind of like a double parabola, with its two separate branches, although the shape is actually quite different.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5aVROOmI-Q#t=0.16s
Evaluating Improper Integrals	We just integrate from t to b, and see what happens in the limit of t approaching negative infinity. If we are evaluating an improper integral and we do get a finite number as an answer, then we say that the interval is convergent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JOIhPfXnxc#t=230.82s
Evaluating Improper Integrals	If the limit does not exist, meaning the area truly is infinite, we say that the interval is divergent. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to tell whether an integral is convergent or divergent just by looking at it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JOIhPfXnxc#t=247.16s
Evaluating and Graphing Exponential Functions	As we can see, the function grows very rapidly as X increases. This number that is raised to the exponent is called the base, and changing the base will produce different exponential functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaDItpC8OI#t=55.819s
Adding and Subtracting Polynomials	It’s Professor Dave, let’s work with polynomials. So we’ve defined the polynomial as a concept, it’s an expression or equation involving multiple terms that each include a variable raised to some positive whole number exponent, which may also be multiplied by some coefficient.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aJBtUOXpsk#t=0.52s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	It’s Professor Dave, let’s learn more about triangles. Let’s quickly identify some other lines that we can draw on triangles. One line we could draw is a perpendicular bisector. This is a line that is perpendicular to one of the sides of the triangle and cuts that side into two line segments of equal length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=0.38s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	This also makes the two smaller triangles congruent. Besides perpendicular bisectors, we can also describe angle bisectors, which are lines that cut an angle in half. Any point on this angle bisector will be equidistant from the two other lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=44.87s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	The circumcenter of the triangle will also be the center of the circle that circumscribes that triangle. This is the circle that contains all three vertices of the triangle. We can also discuss what happens if we bisect all the angles of a triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=113.939s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	The incenter will be the center of the circle that is inscribed in the triangle, which is the circle that intersects each side of the triangle at precisely one point. These theorems can be used to prove all kinds of things about various triangles, like the measure of certain angles and the lengths of certain line segments, we just use the postulates strategically.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=155.08s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	Now instead of a bisector, let’s look at something called a median. A median of a triangle is a line segment that connects one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=182.73s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	But it’s not, so it’s just a median. If we find the point where all three medians meet, this is called the centroid of the triangle, and like the incenter, this is always inside the triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=206.98s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	If we have to extend the opposite side in one direction or the other to get this, that’s what we do, we just need to make a right angle. Each triangle has three altitudes, one per vertex, and the place where these altitudes converge is called the orthocenter of the triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=254.87s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	So to quickly summarize, the point where perpendicular bisectors meet is called the circumcenter. Notice the right angles at the midpoints of the sides. This will be equidistant from the vertices. The point where the angle bisectors meet is called the incenter.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=276.03s
Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes	This will be equidistant from the sides. The point where the three medians meet is called the centroid, and the point where the three altitudes meet is called the orthocenter. Again, notice the right angles required to get the orthocenter, whereas for the centroid the angles can have any value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByWrUSKHTGc#t=294.72s
Absolute Values: Defining, Calculating, and Graphing	It’s important to know what these are and how to graph them, so let’s become familiar with this definition. The absolute value of any real number X, which is denoted by these little bracket type things, is the distance from zero to that number on a number line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wirk4o3FHPA#t=19.05s
Absolute Values: Defining, Calculating, and Graphing	That brings us to a more practical definition of absolute value, as being the magnitude of a number disregarding its sign. Positive numbers are unchanged by taking the absolute value, while negative numbers simple drop the negative sign and become positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wirk4o3FHPA#t=51.399s
Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cosecant, Secant, and Cotangent	Now we must learn the reciprocals of these functions. Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine. If sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite. Secant is the reciprocal of cosine, so instead of adjacent over hypotenuse, it’s hypotenuse over adjacent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqIZue-plBI#t=180.41s
Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cosecant, Secant, and Cotangent	Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so instead of opposite over adjacent, it’s adjacent over opposite. So we definitely have to memorize SOHCAHTOA, and then we just have to memorize which functions are the reciprocals of these three, since we can just flip these ones to get the others.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqIZue-plBI#t=202.36s
Introduction to Calculus: The Greeks, Newton, and Leibniz	For this reason, they developed something called the method of exhaustion. This is where they would inscribe a triangle into the circle, and then gradually increase the number of sides of this polygon.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBVi_9qAKTU#t=111.68s
Introduction to Calculus: The Greeks, Newton, and Leibniz	It is precisely this kind of logic that we will use to do calculus, when we try to find the area under a curve, meaning the area of the section in between a function and the x-axis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBVi_9qAKTU#t=178.919s
Orthogonality and Orthonormality	Of course that is true, but now it’s time to expand on this basic understanding, so let’s go in for a closer look. First, let’s recall the basic definition we just mentioned, whereby two vectors in a vector space are considered orthogonal if they are perpendicular to one another, which means that the angle between them is half pi radians, or ninety degrees.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqMegdbxik#t=20.189s
Orthogonality and Orthonormality	Now let’s expand on this basic concept. In addition to vectors being orthogonal, we can use another restriction on some vectors to create another useful concept, orthonormality. The “normal” part here refers to the vectors having a length of 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqMegdbxik#t=121.73s
Orthogonality and Orthonormality	If a set of vectors are all of length 1 and also orthogonal, they are said to be orthonormal. We have already seen that one way to get the length of a vector is to take the square root of the dot product involving the vector and itself, meaning the length of vector A is equal to the square root of A dot A. Now, if we then divide the original vector by that length, we will get a new vector that will be of length 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqMegdbxik#t=140.46s
Orthogonality and Orthonormality	Here, the word “unit” means that they have lengths that are equal to one. This process of making vectors into unit vectors is often called “normalization”. By doing this we have only changed the magnitude of the vectors, and not the direction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqMegdbxik#t=230.569s
Orthogonality and Orthonormality	Two subspaces, A and B, are said to be orthogonal if every vector in A is orthogonal to every vector in B. So for any vector a in subspace A, and any vector b in subspace B, a dot b must be equal to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqMegdbxik#t=272.89s
Orthogonality and Orthonormality	By transpose, we mean that the columns of the matrix become the rows and vice versa. For example, the transpose of a 2 by 2 matrix and a 3 by 3 matrix are given as shown.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqMegdbxik#t=460.39s
Parametric Equations	We also just learned about polar equations, where R is expressed in terms of theta. But there is one more type of equation we will want to briefly mention, and those are parametric equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaN_3TytT_U#t=20.779s
Parametric Equations	These are sets of equations in which the X and Y values are calculated in separate equations, and each dependent on some other variable. The most common application of this involves two-dimensional motion of objects, like projectile motion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaN_3TytT_U#t=33.83s
Graphing Rational Functions and Their Asymptotes	74) Graphing Rational Functions and Their Asymptotes Professor Dave again, let’s learn about asymptotes. We just learned how to graph higher degree polynomials, but we also need to graph rational functions. These are functions that are expressed as quotients of polynomial functions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy45qX8cUwQ#t=0.269s
Graphing Rational Functions and Their Asymptotes	These are lines that the function approaches, getting closer and closer, but never quite touching. Asymptotes can be vertical, horizontal, or at an angle, and finding these will be the key to graphing rational functions, so let’s learn how to find them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy45qX8cUwQ#t=143.99s
Analyzing Sets of Data: Range, Mean, Median, and Mode	You could tell your friend that you’re having an average day. Whatever the context, the word average implies that something is typical or in some way representative of a larger data set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7Q2yVLZIc#t=19.45s
Analyzing Sets of Data: Range, Mean, Median, and Mode	The median is the value right in the middle of the data set when the values are listed in ascending order. If there are three values, it’s the second one. If there are five, it’s the third.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7Q2yVLZIc#t=134.17s
Analyzing Sets of Data: Range, Mean, Median, and Mode	Lastly there is the mode. The mode is the number that shows up with the greatest frequency, or is present the most times. For this set, that’s two, because there are three twos, which is more than any other number in the set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7Q2yVLZIc#t=182.0s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 2: Ellipses	So that’s one way to define an ellipse. Another way is to say that an ellipse is the set of all points surrounding two foci, whereby the distance from a point to one focus plus the distance from that point to the other focus is constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwRlllkqADw#t=33.19s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 2: Ellipses	The midpoint of the line segment that connects the foci is the center of the ellipse. Ellipses also have two axes of symmetry, a major axis, which will be the longer one, and a minor axis, which is the shorter one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwRlllkqADw#t=65.23s
Estimating Sums Using the Integral Test and Comparison Test	Professor Dave again, let’s check out some tests. We just learned about convergent series, which are ones where the sum of all the terms in the series is some finite number. But it can often be difficult to calculate the precise value of the sum, and there are only certain special cases where we can easily get the sum using simple computation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtnxi9uM7yA#t=0.46s
Estimating Sums Using the Integral Test and Comparison Test	And that is the essence of the integral test. Let’s just mention a few important truths that can be found by applying the integral test. Any series in the form of one over N raised to some exponent is called a P-series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtnxi9uM7yA#t=280.08s
Estimating Sums Using the Integral Test and Comparison Test	There is one more test we can learn that will be an important technique, and it is called the comparison test. With this technique, we will take some series and compare it with a similar series that we know to be convergent or divergent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtnxi9uM7yA#t=329.69s
Understanding Differentiation Part 1: The Slope of a Tangent Line	Say we want to find the equation of a line that is tangent to a curve at some point. With the word tangent, we mean that the line has precisely one point in common with this section of the curve, so there can be only one tangent line, as if the slope were any bigger or smaller, it would necessarily intersect the curve at a second point.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktOYbZ8CpLA#t=22.42s
Understanding Differentiation Part 1: The Slope of a Tangent Line	If we make a different line between these two points, which we call the secant line, we can write an expression to get the slope of this line, because we now have two points, those being the new one, and the point (1, 1) that we started with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktOYbZ8CpLA#t=106.28s
Divisibility, Prime Numbers, and Prime Factorization	Even numbers are the ones that are divisible by two, like two, four, six, eight, and so forth. However, ten is not divisible by three. If we try, we get three remainder one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZWKJG9fxnU#t=37.32s
Divisibility, Prime Numbers, and Prime Factorization	This brings us to an obvious question. Are there any numbers that have no factors whatsoever? Technically no, because any number will have as factors both one and itself. But what about beyond that? Are there any numbers that have no factors besides one and itself? There are indeed many, and numbers that fulfill this criterion are called prime numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZWKJG9fxnU#t=105.29s
Solving Systems Using Cramer's Rule	Cramer’s Rule is a simple algorithm that works precisely the same way for any number of equations with that same number of variables, so long as the system has a unique solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLo-9jh2EM#t=283.01s
Understanding Limits and L'Hospital's Rule	Lastly let’s look at some slightly different forms of the rule. Say we have an indeterminate product, or the limit of a product of functions where one goes to zero and the other goes to positive or negative infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g45quDrSA6g#t=272.719s
Division of Large Numbers: Long Division	Now there are no more digits to drop down, and three doesn’t fit into one, so this is called the remainder. Three fits into six hundred twenty-five, two hundred and eight times, with one left over, or we can say that six hundred twenty-five divided by three is two hundred eight remainder one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI2peJT2Ty8#t=154.099s
Image and Kernel	The set of vectors that we can get from this transformation is what is known as the image of S. One way to think of it is that it’s as if we are shining a light on a part of the vector space V and seeing how much of W gets lit up.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYrvhbDhW4#t=56.209s
Image and Kernel	The area of W that gets lit up is our image. The image of the entire vector space V, denoted this way, has a special name, it is called the “range of L”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYrvhbDhW4#t=74.48s
Image and Kernel	Now let’s move on to kernel. Keeping in mind the fact that our linear transformation maps from V to W, the kernel of L, denoted as shown, is the set of vectors in V that when transformed become the zero vector in W. To keep zero vectors distinct, we will write the zero vector from V as zero sub V, and the zero vector from W as zero sub W. Let’s take our linear transformation from earlier for an example.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYrvhbDhW4#t=151.999s
Image and Kernel	The set of vectors of this form is our kernel. Before we move on, it’s worth noting that the kernel of L is a subspace of V, and for any subspace, S, of V, the image of S is a subspace of W. So any vectors from a kernel or image immediately follow all the properties of subspaces we already learned.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYrvhbDhW4#t=245.499s
Complex Numbers: Operations, Complex Conjugates, and the Linear Factorization Theorem	The first of these concepts is complex numbers. When we were discussing the types of numbers, we said that there are real numbers, which are all the rational and irrational numbers, like negative five, or pi, or seven thirds.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yddjxj49C_M#t=34.91s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 3: Parabolas in Standard Form	Professor Dave again, let’s graph some parabolas. Moving on to another conic section, we have the parabola. This is where a plane intersects a cone, going through the edge of the cone and cutting down to the base of that section, rather than across to the other side of the cone, like with circles and ellipses.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvJkCMzFiX8#t=0.12s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 3: Parabolas in Standard Form	We learned quite a bit about parabolas earlier, when we first learned how to graph functions, but let’s learn the rigid definition. A parabola is the set of all points that are equidistant from a fixed point called the focus, and a fixed line called the directrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvJkCMzFiX8#t=26.97s
Graphing Conic Sections Part 3: Parabolas in Standard Form	From here, we could get additional points by finding the X and Y intercepts. The X intercepts are the points where the function is equal to zero, so we can find them by setting the function equals to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvJkCMzFiX8#t=340.58s
The Vector Dot Product	This means that if you are computing a dot product and you get zero, those two vectors are orthogonal. So that’s what we need to know about vector dot products, which represent one way that vectors can be multiplied.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iNrGpwZwog#t=313.97s
The Vector Dot Product	The other way, called the cross product, is more complicated, and one interpretation will require that we understand how to use matrices. Matrices are the plural of the word matrix, which apart from being a super cool science-fiction movie, is a construct that is ubiquitous in the study of linear algebra, so let’s move forward and begin to study this new subject.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iNrGpwZwog#t=330.81s
Negative Numbers	Hey it’s Professor Dave; let’s take a look at negative numbers. We learned about simple subtraction, whereby if you have ten apples, and someone buys three of them from you, you have seven left.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-5DKCLJspM#t=0.4s
Back to Algebra: What are Functions?	A function is something that relates two quantities, an input value, and an output value. So we can think of it as a little box, and when we insert input values, it spits out the output values, in a way that depends on what the function is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmudKHXSMp4#t=37.149s
Back to Algebra: What are Functions?	If X was two, we would get zero on the bottom, and the function would be undefined, so two is not part of the domain. The range, on the other hand, is all the potential output values, or essentially the values that the function can possess.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmudKHXSMp4#t=256.44s
Transforming Algebraic Functions: Shifting, Stretching, and Reflecting	Professor Dave again, let’s transform some functions. We just learned how to graph some basic functions, like F of X equals X squared. This is a parabola that opens in the positive direction, with its vertex at the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkP1LJR2PyM#t=0.36s
Types of Angles and Angle Relationships	Angles are measurements that are independent of the dimensions of objects, and they are ubiquitous in our every day life. To begin examining angles, we can just look at two rays that start at the same point, which we can call the vertex, and the distance between the rays, denoted by this curved line segment, is an angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA94zyaLuhk#t=49.35s
Types of Angles and Angle Relationships	If an angle is exactly ninety degrees, this is a right angle, and this will be denoted by a square. If the angle is between ninety and one hundred eighty degrees, this is called an obtuse angle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA94zyaLuhk#t=125.829s
Types of Angles and Angle Relationships	This seems intuitive by looking at the diagram, but geometry is all about rigorously proving things that might seem obvious, though we don’t know why. We also have adjacent angles, which are the ones that are next to each other, and if these are the result of two lines crossing like this, these are also called supplementary angles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA94zyaLuhk#t=168.75s
Types of Angles and Angle Relationships	Let’s also recall some relationships between lines. If two lines within a plane intersect at a right angle, they are called perpendicular lines. If two lines within a plane do not intersect, they are called parallel lines.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA94zyaLuhk#t=209.83s
Types of Angles and Angle Relationships	That makes sense because these are supplementary, and this one is equal to this one, so these two must also add up to one eighty. Lastly, angles in the same position with respect to one another are called corresponding angles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA94zyaLuhk#t=294.81s
Properties of Integrals and Evaluating Definite Integrals	Professor Dave here, let’s take some integrals. Hopefully we now understand the relationship between differentiation and integration. These are inverse operations, in the sense that integration requires taking the antiderivative of a function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0RJkIBhfEM#t=0.52s
Solving and Graphing Polynomial and Rational Inequalities	First, let’s recall what an inequality is. Rather than an equation, where the two sides are equivalent to one another, inequalities state that one side is greater than the other, or less than the other, or sometimes greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es37gGo5F4Y#t=19.96s
Understanding Differentiation Part 2: Rates of Change	He then wondered how one could calculate the velocity of the apple at any particular instant during the fall. This is called the instantaneous velocity. Galileo had already discovered some years prior that the distance travelled by a falling object, represented by S of T, would be equal to 4.9 t^2, with t in seconds giving a distance in meters, so Newton could easily use this law to calculate how far something would fall over a given interval of time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J27BZCX1OF8#t=48.85s
Graphing Lines in Standard Form (ax + by = c)	Likewise, the X intercept, or the point where the line crosses the X axis, must have a Y value of zero. For this reason, to find the Y intercept, we can just plug in zero for X.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DnmoFnQUtk#t=62.04s
Multiplying Binomials by the FOIL Method	Now we have to look at binomials. These are expressions with two terms. If we have a monomial times a binomial, again this is very simple, because we just apply the distributive property.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTC7RIwdZcE#t=39.5s
Introduction to Trigonometry: Angles and Radians	The first thing we want to do is recall what we know about angles. Here are two coterminal rays. This means they start at the same point and then go on indefinitely in different directions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GkmnPdD6jY#t=31.9s
Introduction to Trigonometry: Angles and Radians	Whenever we have two different angles that end up at the same spot, these are called coterminal angles, and they will always differ by a multiple of two pi radians, or three hundred sixty degrees.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GkmnPdD6jY#t=261.16s
Multiplication and Division of Small Numbers	Rather than adding two five times, we can just do two times five. The word “times” means multiplication, and in this case multiplying the two by five represents the five successive twos that would otherwise be added together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr04p6Ar9ic#t=95.229s
Multiplication and Division of Small Numbers	Two and five are called factors, and ten is the product. Early on, we will see an X as the symbol for multiplication, but later on in our study of math we won’t see this as often.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr04p6Ar9ic#t=111.71s
Addition and Subtraction of Small Numbers	But let’s remember that math began very simply as part of our language, a set of models and symbols that helped us to communicate ideas and describe our surroundings. Mathematical innovations arose by necessity, and they still do, it’s simply that the frontier of today’s math lies in an abstract place that very few can understand.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7WjNWHOsI#t=42.05s
Addition and Subtraction of Small Numbers	But ten is what we went with, and it works just fine. Getting back to the apples, the basic operations we will learn first are addition and subtraction. Addition is the most basic arithmetic operation, and it represents the combination of two numbers to become a single number, or a sum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7WjNWHOsI#t=165.48s
Addition and Subtraction of Small Numbers	Two and three is five, so five is the sum of this additive operation. The next operation that became necessary was subtraction, which is the inverse, or opposite of addition, in that it doesn’t find the sum of two numbers, it finds their difference.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7WjNWHOsI#t=237.359s
Evaluating the Determinant of a Matrix	Let’s recall that a square matrix is any matrix with an equivalent number of rows and columns, whether two or ten, so let’s learn this algorithm now. Starting with the simplest square matrix, a two by two matrix, with entries A, B, C, and D, the determinant, represented by these vertical lines on either sides of the entries, will be a scalar with the value of AD minus BC.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcbyMH3Noow#t=20.54s
Calculating the Volume of a Solid of Revolution by Integration	This is also integration, just with an extra dimension. Instead of adding up tiny rectangles under a curve in the limit of infinitely thin rectangles, we are adding up infinitely thin cross sections, which we can call disks.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLHJl2_aM5Q#t=76.7s
Calculating the Volume of a Solid of Revolution by Integration	A washer is like a ring, and it will have two radii, the one from the axis of rotation to where the solid starts, which we call the inner radius, and one from the axis of rotation to where the solid ends, or the outer radius.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLHJl2_aM5Q#t=405.259s
Continuous, Discontinuous, and Piecewise Functions	It’s Professor Dave, let’s learn about continuity in functions. We’ve just learned about a variety of functions, and up until now, they have all been continuous functions. These are functions where there are no gaps whatsoever.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQrnx-vvx8#t=0.42s
Continuous, Discontinuous, and Piecewise Functions	That means the line will have one discontinuity, there will be a hole at X equals one where the function can’t be evaluated. Lastly, we can examine piecewise functions. These are when a function is comprised of several pieces, and we evaluate the function differently depending on the number we are plugging in.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQrnx-vvx8#t=176.019s
Diagonalization	Professor Dave again, let’s get diagonal. Now that we have learned about eigenvalues and eigenvectors, it’s time to learn about their applications, so let’s start by learning about something called diagonalization. Diagonalization involves taking a matrix and writing it as a product of matrices, one of which only has values along the diagonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLl03D4TNA#t=0.14s
Introduction to Algebra: Using Variables	Hey it’s Professor Dave, let’s learn some algebra. When you learn math in school, up until a certain point, it’s just called math. Then all of a sudden, one day, math class isn’t just math, it’s called algebra.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdZhuUSmpM#t=0.36s
Introduction to Algebra: Using Variables	This is different from a constant, which is a letter or symbol that represents a quantity that does not change. A variable can be just about anything. The inches of rain in your town in a particular month, the price of gasoline, the speed of a plane, whatever it is that you want to do math with.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdZhuUSmpM#t=51.64s
The Triangle Midsegment Theorem	Professor Dave again, let’s talk about midsegments. We just looked at all kinds of bisectors and other lines that pertain to triangles, so let’s learn just one more type. A midsegment of a triangle is a line segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojMemmYifxM#t=0.1s
The Triangle Midsegment Theorem	Three tick marks, same idea. Furthermore, the triangle midsegment theorem states that any midsegment of a triangle is parallel to one of the sides of the triangle and is also precisely half the length of that side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojMemmYifxM#t=62.359s
Inverse Matrices and Their Properties	We can recall that a number times its reciprocal equals one. Similarly, a matrix times its inverse, or the inverse times the original matrix, will yield an identity matrix, a square matrix with all zeroes except ones across its main diagonal, which is kind of like the number one in matrix form.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWorj5BBy9k#t=63.67s
Inverse Matrices and Their Properties	If a matrix has a determinant that is equal to zero, its inverse will involve dividing by zero, which is undefined, and that matrix will therefore not have an inverse. Such a matrix is called a singular matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWorj5BBy9k#t=406.0s
Inverse Matrices and Their Properties	Then, step three is to find the adjugate, or the adjoint. This involves reflecting all the entries across the diagonal. The diagonal stays as it is, but the other terms are reflected, so these two swap, these two corners swap, and these two swap.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWorj5BBy9k#t=513.33s
The Pythagorean Theorem	In a right triangle, there is one ninety degree angle, by definition. The two sides that meet to form this right angle are called the legs of the triangle, and the third side, the one opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37PX8DV_b9Y#t=45.55s
The Pythagorean Theorem	This theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This is represented by the equation A squared plus B squared equals C squared, where A and B are the legs, and C is the hypotenuse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37PX8DV_b9Y#t=60.93s
Logarithms Part 2: Base Ten Logs, Natural Logs, and the Change-Of-Base Property	The limit of this expression as N approaches infinity is called E, and it is approximately equal to 2.718. If N were equal to infinity, which would mean that interest was being calculated continuously, every single instant, we would get precisely E, and this is an irrational number, meaning that these decimals go on forever with no repeating pattern.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ2ix7QcGwQ#t=143.01s
Logarithms Part 2: Base Ten Logs, Natural Logs, and the Change-Of-Base Property	When we use these, instead of writing log base E of X, we can abbreviate this by writing LN of X. If you see a button on your calculator that says LN, this is the button that takes the natural log of a number, which is the exponent that E must be raised to in order to get that number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ2ix7QcGwQ#t=190.36s
Logarithms Part 2: Base Ten Logs, Natural Logs, and the Change-Of-Base Property	We have to learn a trick called the change-of-base property. This says that if we have some log of X with base B, but we want to express this as a log with some other base, like base A, then log base B of X will be equals to log base A of X over log base A of B. Here is an example so we can get some context.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ2ix7QcGwQ#t=241.989s
Types of Matrices and Matrix Addition	It’s Professor Dave, let’s add matrices. We now know what matrices are. They are simply arrays of numbers, that are often meant to represent the coefficients and constants from a system of linear equations.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyQzy2yRUA#t=0.5s
Types of Matrices and Matrix Addition	First, let’s cover some definitions that may come in handy. We know that any matrix will have some number of rows and some number of columns. If the number of rows and columns is the same, that is called a square matrix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyQzy2yRUA#t=38.89s
Types of Matrices and Matrix Addition	In a square matrix, the entries going from the top left down to the bottom right comprise the main diagonal of the matrix. We can refer to a matrix as a whole as a diagonal matrix if all the entries that are not part of the diagonal are zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyQzy2yRUA#t=55.21s
Types of Matrices and Matrix Addition	Then some other possibilities; a square matrix is called an upper triangular matrix if all the entries below the main diagonal are zero, and it is called a lower triangular matrix if the opposite is true, with the entries above the main diagonal all equal to zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyQzy2yRUA#t=95.34s
Types of Matrices and Matrix Addition	There are also matrices consisting of just one row or column, and these have special names. A matrix with a single column is called a vector. A matrix with a single row is called a row vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyQzy2yRUA#t=115.35s
Types of Quadrilaterals and Other Polygons	Professor Dave again, let’s learn some more shapes. We’ve been talking about triangles for a while now, so let’s talk about shapes with more than three sides. Any shape with four sides is called a quadrilateral, and there are many different types.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZs8bRoWxE#t=0.44s
Types of Quadrilaterals and Other Polygons	The other pair of sides must not be parallel, which can produce a variety of different trapezoids. A kite is a quadrilateral that has two pairs of congruent consecutive sides. That means these two are the same length, and these two are the same length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZs8bRoWxE#t=41.879s
Types of Quadrilaterals and Other Polygons	Any quadrilateral that meets these constraints is called a parallelogram. The diagonals of a parallelogram always bisect one another. Now from here we can narrow things down further. Any parallelogram that has four congruent sides is called a rhombus.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZs8bRoWxE#t=77.4s
Types of Quadrilaterals and Other Polygons	This is a syllogism, a form of deductive reasoning that we can use in everyday arguments. But we won’t get into logic and philosophy here, that will have to wait for another day.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZs8bRoWxE#t=168.24s
Types of Quadrilaterals and Other Polygons	Now that we know the various quadrilaterals, what about shapes with more than four sides? These are called polygons. To be specific, a polygon is any shape formed from three or more line segments, so triangles and quadrilaterals are technically polygons, but since we have specific names for those, we usually only use the word polygon to refer to shapes with five sides are more.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZs8bRoWxE#t=180.33s
Integration By Trigonometric Substitution	Trigonometric substitution is a technique that works when one of three very specific terms is present in the integrand. These are the square root of A squared minus x squared, the square root of A squared plus x squared, or the square root of x squared minus A squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3rzxSgvZZk#t=37.71s
Solving Algebraic Inequalities	It is called the inequality. Instead of an equation that equates two terms, telling us that they are equal, an inequality tells us how two terms are not equal, but rather that one is either greater than the other or less than the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBxs7cSgOes#t=24.63s
Manipulating Matrices: Elementary Row Operations and Gauss-Jordan Elimination	A matrix is in reduced row-echelon form when any row with non-zero entries has a one as its first entry. This is called a leading one. Wherever there is a leading one, all the other entries in that column are zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2Gtt8WygiU#t=480.22s
Manipulating Matrices: Elementary Row Operations and Gauss-Jordan Elimination	The rank is the number of leading ones. If the rank is equal to the number of columns in the coefficient matrix, the system has at most one solution, meaning this will typically result in a unique solution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2Gtt8WygiU#t=515.08s
Linear Independence	Solving a simple system like this is a piece of cake, but often we’ll be dealing with much more complicated systems. However, we can still use the methods we’ve already learned by treating the scalars as our unknown variables. If we solve the system and find only zeros, the vectors are linearly independent, but if we find that any number of scalars are nonzero, or that any scalar can be set to any nonzero value, the system will be linearly dependent. When a variable can take on any value for the system, this is called a “free variable”. The method we can use in such a situation involves setting up a matrix and using row reduction to get it into row echelon form, so that the nonzero elements of the matrix are only on the diagonal and upper right side, as we have learned previously.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kDpbZCK62Y#t=230.42s
The Vector Cross Product	Professor Dave here, let’s find cross products. Earlier in the series, we learned about vectors and their operations, including one way to multiply two vectors together, which we called the dot product.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPnWm-IXoAY#t=0.5s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 2: Calculating Volume	Sometimes we want to calculate the three-dimensional space that is contained within that object, which we can think of as the amount of water we will need to fill up the object if it were perfectly hollow.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-G9_bTKuw#t=19.61s
Three-Dimensional Shapes Part 2: Calculating Volume	A cube is a prism with squares for all its faces. To find the volume of a cube, instead of just squaring the side length, which gives us the area of one square face, we cube the side length to get the volume of the cube.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-G9_bTKuw#t=46.42s
Partial Derivatives and the Gradient of a Function	Now let's say we have a function that depends on both x and y, which we can call f(x,y). This will end up being a surface in space rather a curve, so how can we interpret the rate of change for this? What we end up having to do is to find the rate of change in specific directions independently. If we want the rate of change in the x direction, much like we have been doing already, we simply differentiate with respect to x while treating y as a constant.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXH9Xm6Rbfc#t=150.4s
Inverse Functions	Inverse functions are not just reciprocals of the original function. Instead, we must do some algebra to find the inverse of a particular function, but we will always use the same approach.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fJsrnE1go0#t=38.32s
Basic Euclidean Geometry: Points, Lines, and Planes	First we look at a point. This is nothing more than a location in space. It is zero-dimensional, meaning that it has no dimensions of any kind. We represent points with little dots and some capital letter, making sure to realize that the dot we draw is infinitely larger than the point it is meant to represent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMB_ob89qs#t=49.38s
Basic Euclidean Geometry: Points, Lines, and Planes	This can be achieved by stringing an infinite number of lines along a dimension perpendicular to the line. This is called a plane. And then if we string an infinite number of planes in either direction, we get three-dimensional space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMB_ob89qs#t=91.54s
Basic Euclidean Geometry: Points, Lines, and Planes	Just to list a bit more terminology, while a line extends infinitely along its one dimension in both directions, if we chop one end off, giving it a definite starting point, we call this a ray.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMB_ob89qs#t=175.39s
Basic Euclidean Geometry: Points, Lines, and Planes	If we chop off both ends, leaving some chunk left over in the middle, this is called a line segment. Line segments have two endpoints, rays have one endpoint, and lines have none.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMB_ob89qs#t=188.64s
Derivatives of Polynomial Functions: Power Rule, Product Rule, and Quotient Rule	Similarly, there is the difference rule, which works just like the sum rule, stating that (f minus g) quantity prime equals f prime minus g prime. That means that no matter how many terms are in a polynomial, we will just take the derivative of one term at a time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL15O6rS9z0#t=234.25s
Introduction to Polynomials	These are called polynomials, and they are expressions that contain an unknown raised to various positive whole number exponents. This could be something like two X squared plus four X plus ten equals zero.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPPNgin7W7Y#t=19.82s
Introduction to Polynomials	Again, there is no firm reason for this, it’s just convention. We should also note that the highest power present in the polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. If the degree is two, it is a second degree polynomial, also known as a quadratic polynomial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPPNgin7W7Y#t=113.87s
Introduction to Polynomials	Third degree is known as cubic. Fourth degree is called quartic. Fifth degree is called quintic, and beyond that we don’t really have names, we would just say sixth degree, seventh degree, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPPNgin7W7Y#t=133.14s
Stokes's Theorem	Professor Dave here, I wanna tell you about Stokes’s Theorem. Previously, we went over Green’s Theorem, which let us turn the line integral for a closed curve C in two dimensions into a double integral. Stokes’s Theorem can be thought of as a higher dimensional version, when we have a closed curve in three dimensions, where the curve is the boundary of a surface S. Just as with Green’s theorem, we assume that the curve is positively oriented, which means the path of the curve goes in the counterclockwise direction with respect to the normal vector of the surface. Now if we have a vector field permeating space, to find the amount of the field that goes in the direction of the curve we would need to take the line integral of F along C. Stokes’s Theorem gives us another method of finding this line integral, which can lead to simpler calculations. The theorem states that the line integral of F along C is equal to the surface integral of the curl of F dot n over the surface S. We discussed how to calculate surface integrals in the previous tutorial, so we have seen that they aren’t too difficult to solve, it’s just that now we have the extra step of taking a curl. Remember that the curl of a vector field is calculated by taking del cross F, where del was the vector .	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS-zUSu-nxA#t=0.5s
What is Integration? Finding the Area Under a Curve	In geometry we learned about the concept of area, which is the amount of two-dimensional surface covered by a figure. We also learned how to calculate the area of all kinds of different polygons, using specific formulas.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsC3do74UIo#t=60.949s
Convergence and Divergence: The Return of Sequences and Series	Sometimes we can use special techniques, like using L’Hospital’s rule on the related function, or something called the squeeze theorem. This one says that if there are three sequences, A, B, and C, and B is always between A and C, then if A and C both have a limit of L, then B must also have a limit of L, because it is being squeezed in between these ones.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-JqHo4-W4k#t=135.05s
Convergence and Divergence: The Return of Sequences and Series	If we recall the definition of a geometric sequence, it is one in which you multiply each term by some constant to get the next one, so starting with A, we get AR, then ARR, or AR squared, then AR cubed, and so forth.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-JqHo4-W4k#t=353.84s
Types of Triangles in Euclidean Geometry	This fact will help us algebraically determine the measures of certain angles later. Triangles can be classified not just by angles, but also by side lengths. A scalene triangle is defined as having three sides of different lengths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ5AuNVjxhI#t=80.69s
The Easiest Way to Memorize the Trigonometric Unit Circle	Let’s quickly go over some key points about the unit circle that will make it very easy to remember. First we must recall what sine and cosine are. From SOHCATOA, sine means the length of the leg opposite the angle over the length of the hypotenuse, and cosine means the length of the leg adjacent to the angle over the length of the hypotenuse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75dMcyCUo2g#t=34.69s
Lecture 32: Markov Chains Continued | Statistics 110	Irreducible means you can get from anywhere to anywhere, so, if it's possible. By possible, I mean with positive probability to get from anywhere in the chain. Not necessarily in one step, but in some finite number of steps, from anywhere to anywhere.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBGOyZv2pZE#t=336.8s
Lecture 32: Markov Chains Continued | Statistics 110	Now we're talking about one particular state within the chain, and it's called recurrent. If it's true that If the chain starts in that state, it's guaranteed to come back. So if starting there, chain has probability one of returning, To that state.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBGOyZv2pZE#t=468.143s
Lecture 32: Markov Chains Continued | Statistics 110	And how do we know the other thing. Stationary distribution is also called equilibrium or steady state, all these terms from physics or econ that are saying it's something to do with long run behavior.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBGOyZv2pZE#t=1440.22s
Lecture 32: Markov Chains Continued | Statistics 110	Reversible chains, just in general, are much nicer and easier to work with than non-reversible chains. Reversible, here's the definition. So a chain, a Markov chain with transition matrix that we've been writing Q, Q, and let's say individual elements of Q are just written as (q i j), that's row i, column j, is called reversible if there is a probability vector S such that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBGOyZv2pZE#t=1780.15s
Lecture 32: Markov Chains Continued | Statistics 110	Reversibility says that if you then took that tape and played it backwards in time, you reversed it, and you showed that to someone else, they would not know whether it was going forwards or backwards in time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBGOyZv2pZE#t=2022.34s
Lecture 11: The Poisson distribution | Statistics 110	So this is what I call sympathetic magic. Sympathetic magic is what I call the mistake of confusing a random variable with its distribution. So an example of that. That has come up on some of the homeworks, is you have a sum of two random variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD1N4hxqMzY#t=35.19s
Lecture 11: The Poisson distribution | Statistics 110	All right? Assuming that the people, as usual, we assume the people are labelled as 1 through n, take any subset of three people, I call that a triplet. For each triplet you want can ask the question does that triplet have the property all three of them have the same birthday or not, right? So we would create an indicator random variable for each one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD1N4hxqMzY#t=2222.621s
Lecture 10: Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	Remember a random variable is a mapping from the sample space. The sample space is the set of all pebbles to the real line. So suppose I've arranged my pebbles, just for simplicity in that picture I'm assuming X can only take on these four possible values, but the same idea would work for any discrete random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fSFvhPf7Q#t=369.884s
Lecture 10: Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	Any discrete random variable, conceptually, looks something like this. Now let's just make an observation about how we can do our summation, E(X), we defined it to be the sum over all values x of x times the PMF.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fSFvhPf7Q#t=414.46s
Lecture 10: Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	Especially when it's actually counting. That is, you could use the naive definition of probability. Although, that would actually not be a good idea here. So by random they mean that all permutations are equally likely.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fSFvhPf7Q#t=1858.57s
Lecture 10: Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	3214756. So, that's a permutation of 1 through 7. Local maxima is any number that's bigger than its neighbors. So 7, I'm going to circle the local maxima. 7 is bigger than 4 and 5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fSFvhPf7Q#t=1920.32s
Lecture 10: Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	There are n-2 intermediate points, each of them is one-third probability. That is the expected value of, remember the fundamental bridge? The expected value of an indicator is the probability of the event.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fSFvhPf7Q#t=2214.67s
Lecture 10: Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	What value would make peace? What price would make the expected value zero, okay, that would often be called the fair price. Although whether you actually want to pay that or not depends on your own gambling preferences.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fSFvhPf7Q#t=2500.36s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	So I did my undergrad at Cal Tech. And at Cal Tech, everyone's hero is Richard Feynman, who was one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. And people like to say that Feynman also had an algorithm, a general problem solving algorithm that Feynman used.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=150.874s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	And suppose that the patient tests positive, that's the result. And even though testing positive sounds good, that's actually bad. Tests positive means that the test is asserting that the patient has the disease.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=1168.974s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	So Sally Clark was a British woman who had, two of her babies both died for mysterious, unexplained reasons. So they were calling it like SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. That basically just meant the two babies died and they had no explanation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=2052.54s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	And that expert said, assuming that she's innocent, the probability of a baby just spontaneously dying for no apparent reason. The so called expert, said that the probability is 1 in 8500, I don't know where he got that number from, but let's just accept that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=2090.55s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	So I wanna tell you what the word prior and the word posterior mean. So the second mistake is confusing P(A), that's called the prior. Prior means before we have evidence, posterior means after we have evidence.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=2323.665s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	With P(A|B), which is called the posterior. So one instance of that is, sometimes students, if the problem says that A occurs, and then they would be very tempted to write P(A) = 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=2345.11s
Lecture 5: Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability | Statistics 110	So it may happen that the games are conditionally independent. I'll say game outcomes are conditionally independent, but not independent. And when I say conditionally independent, I mean conditionally independent given the strength of your opponent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzDvVgNDxo8#t=2716.29s
Lecture 15: Midterm Review | Statistics 110	And it gets really nasty if the probabilities are unequal. But in this case it works out really nicely. So the question is find the expected time to collect a full set, where time is just measured discretely in terms of how many toys you need to buy, right? Expected time, i.e., number of toys, Until you have a complete set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRZf81sB5k#t=152.159s
Lecture 15: Midterm Review | Statistics 110	And there was nothing special about one-third here, you could do this for whatever number you want between 0 and 1. That's the uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is saying that probability is proportional to length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRZf81sB5k#t=783.3s
Lecture 15: Midterm Review | Statistics 110	Well, lastly I just want to remind you again, be very careful of the difference between, we sort of have three classes of objects. We have our distributions, the distribution is the blueprint for creating a random variable, that was our random house.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRZf81sB5k#t=2256.323s
Lecture 13: Normal distribution | Statistics 110	So to compute this probability we just need to multiply the separate CDF's. This thing here that I wrote down is called the joint CDF. Because this is the CDF of all the random variables considered jointly as one probability thing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QjzHnYvL0#t=1036.771s
Lecture 13: Normal distribution | Statistics 110	So this is stronger than just pairwise independence. Pairwise independence would say if you know one random variable, doesn't tell you any information about any other one random variable. Full independence means knowing any of them, any collection of them tells you nothing about ones that you don't know.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QjzHnYvL0#t=1198.53s
Lecture 13: Normal distribution | Statistics 110	So if you want, just think of flipping a fair coin twice, and then this is kind of like an old game that people used to play called matching pennies. Where each person like you know pulls out a penny and see whether it's the same, or not one person wins if they're the same.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QjzHnYvL0#t=1244.54s
Lecture 13: Normal distribution | Statistics 110	Central limit theorem, The central limit theorem is possibly the most famous and important theorem in all of probability, so we're definitely gonna talk about it later. And it's kind of a very, very surprising result.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QjzHnYvL0#t=1463.39s
Lecture 13: Normal distribution | Statistics 110	And what I mean by, well, to qualify that a bit, there is one way we could do this integral that will work. And that is the definite integral, that is, that's e to a power.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QjzHnYvL0#t=1864.61s
Lecture 13: Normal distribution | Statistics 110	Polar coordinates just says, represent points in terms of a radius and an angle rather than in terms of the cartesian coordinates of x and y. So we're going to convert from x,y to r theta, that is polar coordinates.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QjzHnYvL0#t=2196.02s
Lecture 25: Order Statistics and Conditional Expectation | Statistics 110	And this is just the definition right now. Order statistics means we put them in order, and then those are the order statistics. Which sounds pretty simple but you really have to think carefully at what does it actually mean to do that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LR5JYbhyjg#t=1486.44s
Lecture 25: Order Statistics and Conditional Expectation | Statistics 110	So we have to be very careful about that dependence. And also they're tricky in the discreet case, so we're mostly gonna assume the continuous case. Discreet case we have to worry about ties, that is two random variables being exactly equal, that's a serious issue in the discrete case.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LR5JYbhyjg#t=1760.61s
Lecture 28: Inequalities | Statistics 110	So for random variable, a lot of you have seen Cauchy-Schwarz in the linear algebra or math class. For random variables, Cauchy–Schwarz says that the expected value of X times Y is less than or equal to the square root of E(X) squared E(Y) squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtXK_EQ3Pow#t=1126.33s
Lecture 28: Inequalities | Statistics 110	So Jensen's inequality, Says that if lower case g is a convex function, and I'll remind you of what that is, then for any random variable x. Expected value of g of x is greater than or equal to g expected value of x.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtXK_EQ3Pow#t=1457.0s
Lecture 28: Inequalities | Statistics 110	The very last topic in Stat 110 is gonna be Markov chains. Same Markov, different idea. Markov's inequality says that the probability that any random variable x, let's say absolute value of x is greater than or equal to a, is less than or equal to expected value of absolute value of x divided by a for any constant a greater than 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtXK_EQ3Pow#t=2142.248s
Lecture 12: Discrete vs. Continuous, the Uniform | Statistics 110	Okay, so it's probability per something, but not probability. So we say that x, this is a definition. A random variable, X, has PDF F(x) if in order to find probabilities for X we can achieve that by integrating the PDF.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tci---bVs60#t=355.65s
Lecture 12: Discrete vs. Continuous, the Uniform | Statistics 110	So that's the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus says that if you wanna do a definite integral, you find anti-derivative and then evaluate it at the two end points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tci---bVs60#t=958.3s
Lecture 12: Discrete vs. Continuous, the Uniform | Statistics 110	And somehow we want a concept where it's not gonna, it doesn't care where it is, right? So in other words we could say that probability, so for the uniform means that probability is proportional to length.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tci---bVs60#t=1895.0s
Lecture 31: Markov Chains | Statistics 110	In a general stochastic process, maybe you can't simplify this very much. But this is too complicated. The Markov structure means that only the most recent information matters. We can get rid of everything else.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AJPs3gvNlY#t=664.74s
Lecture 31: Markov Chains | Statistics 110	Markov Chain Monte Carlo means that you synthetically construct your own Markov Chain. You then can't argue is it Markov or not, because you built your own chain. Why would you want to build your own chain? Well, the idea, which is a very beautiful, one of the most useful and beautiful ideas of the 20th century, in my opinion.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AJPs3gvNlY#t=1378.61s
Lecture 6: Monty Hall, Simpson's Paradox | Statistics 110	First one, a lot of you have seen in some form or other. And that's called the Monty Hall problem, the three door problem. Very, very famous problem, it's been in movies, on TV, and New York Times articles about this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDcjhAKuhqQ#t=14.731s
Lecture 6: Monty Hall, Simpson's Paradox | Statistics 110	Which is that Monty always opens, he's always gonna offer you that choice, so he's always gonna open a goat door. I'm just saying goat door is a door with a goat.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDcjhAKuhqQ#t=268.95s
Lecture 6: Monty Hall, Simpson's Paradox | Statistics 110	That's either Door 1, 2, or 3, right? And they're equally likely by assumption, that's the first branch. Secondly, we have Monty door, that's whatever door that Monty Hall opens. And let's just consider the cases.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDcjhAKuhqQ#t=644.43s
Lecture 6: Monty Hall, Simpson's Paradox | Statistics 110	This is just the conditional form of the law of total probability. Conditional probabilities are probabilities, so I can do Bayes' rule, law of total probability, anything I want, it's gonna work the same way, just everything's given B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDcjhAKuhqQ#t=2561.32s
Lecture 2: Story Proofs, Axioms of Probability | Statistics 110	And suppose that the actual outcome of the experiment was s0. Now, if that actual outcome is an element of A, then we say that A occurred. And if this s0 is outside of A, we say it doesn't occur.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJd_1H3rZGg#t=2632.63s
Lecture 17: Moment Generating Functions | Statistics 110	And there are sort of two sorts of homework problems, roughly speaking. One is a type where just like you have to do a certain calculation, and you do the calculation, and then you're done.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8O6zd6vTZ8#t=379.33s
Lecture 17: Moment Generating Functions | Statistics 110	That is, it takes values from zero to infinity, with the memoryless property, So the memoryless property is a property of the distribution, not of the random variable itself, per se. But we would say the random variable has the memoryless property if its distribution has the memoryless property.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8O6zd6vTZ8#t=511.951s
Lecture 17: Moment Generating Functions | Statistics 110	Continuous means that if we take the limit of something like this, you can swap the limit and the G. So by continuity, this is true for any positive real numbers. Let's say, G(xt) = G(t) to the x for any real x > 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8O6zd6vTZ8#t=911.031s
Lecture 17: Moment Generating Functions | Statistics 110	In general, finding the distribution of a sum of independent random variables is complicated, that's called a convolution. But if we have access to MGFs, things are a lot easier. Convolution, you have to do this convolution sum or convolution integral which we'll deal with somewhat later.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8O6zd6vTZ8#t=1663.78s
Lecture 17: Moment Generating Functions | Statistics 110	So the Bayesian approach is treat P as a random variable. The reason it's called Bayesian is because then we can use Bayes' rule to say what's the distribution of p given all the evidence we have, right? So we start with some prior beliefs about p, that is before we have any data or any evidence, we have some prior uncertainty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8O6zd6vTZ8#t=2454.42s
Lecture 17: Moment Generating Functions | Statistics 110	But p itself is random with the uniform distribution. That's the structure, okay? And the problem is defined, first of all find the posterior distribution. By definition, posterior distribution means the distribution after we collect the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8O6zd6vTZ8#t=2595.988s
Lecture 3: Birthday Problem, Properties of Probability | Statistics 110	Because often you have problems where you have to have clever ways of storing information in the different data structures. And problems happen when two things try to store them in the same way, that's called a collision.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5Wergp_PA#t=420.213s
Lecture 3: Birthday Problem, Properties of Probability | Statistics 110	And you know P is a function that takes events as input and returns a number between 0 and 1, satisfies this and this. As long as that's true, then we consider P a probability, and every theorem about probability that we do then is applicable, and we don't have to worry what does it really mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5Wergp_PA#t=1309.33s
Lecture 3: Birthday Problem, Properties of Probability | Statistics 110	The general case, when we have the union of n events, The general form of inclusion-exclusion, If you remember this, then it's really easy to write this down, it looks ugly, but it's the same idea.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5Wergp_PA#t=2175.45s
Lecture 3: Birthday Problem, Properties of Probability | Statistics 110	In other words, the Jth card in the deck is numbered as card J. Okay. So what we are interested in is the probability of the union. That is just a mathematical expression for the probability that at least one card matches.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5Wergp_PA#t=2518.34s
Lecture 3: Birthday Problem, Properties of Probability | Statistics 110	Well let's just kind of do some kind of scratch calculations. Do some scratch work over here. P(Aj), P(Aj) is the probability that the jth card in the deck is card j Now you can do this using a naive definition of probability because we're assuming...there's two ways to think of this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5Wergp_PA#t=2592.42s
Lecture 20: Multinomial and Cauchy | Statistics 110	Whereas here, you have to do a double integral, here I just write down LOTUS. So I'll do this quickly, cuz on the strategic practice, it's just write down LOTUS. Integral minus infinity, to infinity |z| 1 over root 2 pi e to -z squared over 2 dz, And notice that this is an even function, That is, if we replace z by -z, we get the same thing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVWNkQUqKk#t=395.256s
Lecture 20: Multinomial and Cauchy | Statistics 110	One is the multinomial, which we are about to do. The other one is the multinomial which is the generalization of the normal distribution to higher dimensions, and we'll get to that one later, okay? So multinomial as the name might suggest it's a generalization of the binomial, right? Bi becomes multi, okay? So it's like a higher dimensional version of the binomial, and let's just introduce it by its story.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVWNkQUqKk#t=537.189s
Lecture 20: Multinomial and Cauchy | Statistics 110	Multinomial means instead of two categories, we have k categories, okay? So it's a natural extension, right? And binomial, we have to classify everything as either success or failure for each trial.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVWNkQUqKk#t=638.021s
Lecture 20: Multinomial and Cauchy | Statistics 110	So that's why I call it the lumping property, lump all the other parties together. So what if we considered, let's see, let Y = X1, X2, and then group all these ones together.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVWNkQUqKk#t=1290.362s
Lecture 20: Multinomial and Cauchy | Statistics 110	But if you come to my office hours, you can see them in my office. But little pillows illustrating different distributions, I have them in my office. The Cauchy is called the evil Cauchy and it looks pretty evil.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVWNkQUqKk#t=1787.65s
Lecture 20: Multinomial and Cauchy | Statistics 110	That's the problem, okay? So the Cauchy is the distribution of let's say, X over Y with x and y iid standard normal. So it's a simple definition, just take a ratio of two iid standard normals and we call that a Cauchy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVWNkQUqKk#t=1818.19s
Lecture 33: Markov Chains Continued Further | Statistics 110	So let's call this w12, I'm just gonna put little weights on the edges. This is w11, w14 I'm not gonna fill them all in. In general, let's say we have wij, Greater than or equal to 0, we call that an edge weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-pCzTpwPBU#t=190.328s
Lecture 33: Markov Chains Continued Further | Statistics 110	Okay, so then this equation should make some sense, right? The importance is based on the importance of the pages that link to it. qij is zero, unless there's actually a link from i to j.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-pCzTpwPBU#t=1741.45s
Lecture 23: Beta distribution | Statistics 110	There's some calculus involved in thinking about and valuing derivatives. A financial derivative, the term derivative means derives from. So a financial derivative is a contract so it's a bet, an agreement, between two people whose payout at some maturity date is a function of, or derives from, the value of some other Random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZjlBQbV1KU#t=1889.49s
Lecture 23: Beta distribution | Statistics 110	Build time series models, you can think about economies. But one thing you can do is just build a little probabilistic model, and that's what we're gonna do here. Very straightforward one, which takes two states of the world.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZjlBQbV1KU#t=2234.87s
Lecture 23: Beta distribution | Statistics 110	All right, okay, there's a pretty straightforward model, don't you think? Might go up, might go down. Okay, all right, now we've gotta ask the question where do we expect it to be in a years time? Well, we can do expected value, expectation very easily.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZjlBQbV1KU#t=2332.711s
Lecture 23: Beta distribution | Statistics 110	A warrant is a type of financial derivative, okay, called a call option. So this is their equivalent to what's called a call option, which. Okay, and what a call option was or is, is the following.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZjlBQbV1KU#t=2648.276s
Lecture 34: A Look Ahead | Statistics 110	And in practice, it may be extremely difficult to get a simple random sample. That is where all samples of a certain size are equally likely, and it's not always necessarily even desirable to have a simple random sample.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChS3K2O-h7o#t=1405.605s
Lecture 24: Gamma distribution and Poisson process | Statistics 110	Just use the memoryless property. Memoryless property says, no matter how long you've waited, waiting for this second email but starting at this point in time it's just starting over again so it's just the same problem again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjeswpm0cWY#t=1695.38s
Lecture 24: Gamma distribution and Poisson process | Statistics 110	We want to know that distribution. So therefore we can think of Tn So let's define Tn to be the time of the nth arrival, nth email, nth phone call, or whatever.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjeswpm0cWY#t=1779.68s
Lecture 16: Exponential Distribution | Statistics 110	I have to tell you what that means, and then check that is true, okay? So memoryless property means that, See if we can remember that midterm practice problem. What is said something about memorylessness, it said no matter how long you've waited then it's like you're starting over from fresh, okay? I think that's what it said, right? So it says that if you have a random variable that, intuitively it's a random variable that we interpret as a waiting time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM6nFDjvEns#t=700.4s
Lecture 16: Exponential Distribution | Statistics 110	Let's just use the definition of conditional probability. So this is the probability that X is greater than or equal to s + t. And X is greater than or equal s divided by the probability that X is greater than or equal to s.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM6nFDjvEns#t=935.276s
Lecture 27: Conditional Expectation given an R.V. | Statistics 110	This is just a practice, you know what does the concept mean? E(Y given X) is E(X squared given X). This notation means we get to treat x as known and then we try to give our best prediction for x squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjBvCiRt8QA#t=68.842s
Lecture 27: Conditional Expectation given an R.V. | Statistics 110	So it's says we want the expected value of Y, but we don't know how to do it, we can try to cleverly choose X to make the problem simpler, where E of Y given X is simpler to work with, and then take the expected value of that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjBvCiRt8QA#t=720.51s
Lecture 21: Covariance and Correlation | Statistics 110	All right, so that shows us how, property one says how covariance is related to variance, but it doesn't show us how it would be useful in actually computing a variance, the variance of a sum that is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IujCYxtpszU#t=876.35s
Lecture 21: Covariance and Correlation | Statistics 110	This just says merge the first two categories together into one bigger category, okay? If we do that, It's still binomial, right? Now we're defining success to mean being a member of category one or category two.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IujCYxtpszU#t=2318.513s
Lecture 22: Transformations and Convolutions | Statistics 110	So all I'm saying to do is plug in g inverse of y here, then it's a function of y. Dx dy is the derivative of x with respect to y viewed as a function of y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwPUAIvFyg#t=690.58s
Lecture 22: Transformations and Convolutions | Statistics 110	And let's let Y =, log normal does not mean the log of a normal. You can't take the log of a normal random variable, because you can't take the log of a negative number.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwPUAIvFyg#t=990.629s
Lecture 22: Transformations and Convolutions | Statistics 110	Log normal means, so this is log normal example. Log normal means that the log is normal, not log of the normal. So if you take, z is standard normal here. More generally you could let z be normal mu sigma squared.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwPUAIvFyg#t=1002.397s
Lecture 22: Transformations and Convolutions | Statistics 110	Sometimes we need a more direct method. So in the discrete case, we've already done calculations like this. So we want, so let's let T equal X plus Y. And we want to know the distribution of T assuming we know the distribution of X and the distribution of Y that's called the convolution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwPUAIvFyg#t=1646.11s
Lecture 22: Transformations and Convolutions | Statistics 110	Shannon theorem, was that he showed that if you're trying to communicate over a noisy channel, so you're trying to send messages from one place to another, but bits get corrupted, things, there's a lot of noise and interference, or whatever.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwPUAIvFyg#t=2372.862s
Lecture 22: Transformations and Convolutions | Statistics 110	So I can find two committees, or there exist two committees, where a group of three people is on both committees. So show there exists, two committees With overlap greater than or equal to 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwPUAIvFyg#t=2588.87s
Lecture 14: Location, Scale, and LOTUS | Statistics 110	And sigma is any positive number, mu could be negative, sigma has to be positive, and that's called the standard deviation. Remember standard deviation we defined as the square root of variance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vp1Ll2NpRw#t=304.52s
Lecture 14: Location, Scale, and LOTUS | Statistics 110	Those are the weights. This says, first combine all of the pebbles that have the same value of x into you know, super-pebbles. A super-pebble means we grouped together all pebbles with the same x value, not the same g(x) value, the same x value.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vp1Ll2NpRw#t=2738.08s
Lecture 14: Location, Scale, and LOTUS | Statistics 110	In other words, that's what I called a super pebble. The super pebble, the mass is the sum of all the masses of the little pebbles that form the super pebble. That's p of, this is just practice, this is going back to the very beginning of, events and what's a random variable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vp1Ll2NpRw#t=2898.28s
Lecture 1: Probability and Counting | Statistics 110	So let me tell you what a sample space is first, then I'll give you the naive definition. So a sample space-- sample space just means the set of all possible outcomes of some experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw#t=905.37s
Lecture 1: Probability and Counting | Statistics 110	OK? So what I just said was very, very general, right? And I mean, that could describe any number of situations. So a sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw#t=949.9s
Lecture 1: Probability and Counting | Statistics 110	Multiplication rule says that if we have an experiment-- again, I'm going to say this kind of abstractly because this is a general principle, and then we'll see examples of how to use this.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw#t=1768.24s
Lecture 1: Probability and Counting | Statistics 110	OK? So that's where this thing comes from. All right. Now coming back to this full house problem, a full house is defined as having three cards of one rank and two of another.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw#t=2328.65s
Lecture 1: Probability and Counting | Statistics 110	So sampling means we have some population of items or people or anything, and we're drawing a sample. So we're choosing k objects out of n, and we want to know how many ways are there to do it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw#t=2516.73s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	But for the Poisson I wanna show you the other important reasons. So let's let x be Poisson lambda and find its MGF again. Well, let's just use LOTUS, the expected value of E(e to tx) = the sum, so Poisson takes non-negative integer values so I'll just say k equals 0 infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=1105.45s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	It's completely analogous to the individual CDF. So the joint CDF is the function of two variables now. F(x,y) = the probability X less than or equal to x, Y less than or equal to Y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=1800.94s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	Okay if they're independent, that's equivalent to independence is you can split this up. Okay, so now there's another concept that we need called marginal The marginal distribution, marginal just means take them separately.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=1869.572s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	So the marginal distribution for x would be a probably x less than or equal x is called the marginal distribution of x. Similarly marginal PMF would just be just this part, okay? So therefore in words, we could say that marginal Independence means that the joint distribution, the joint CDF is the product of the marginal CDFs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=1887.73s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	And when we do normally we can just think of it as one single integral and another single integral so just do two integrals. But the intuition should be clear, right? The PDF is what you integrate to get a probability.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=2011.864s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	So it's completely analogous. And so independence means that We've already talked about this before, I'm just using new terminology for it. Independence means that the joint x and y are independent.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=2027.085s
Lecture 18: MGFs Continued | Statistics 110	One would be so I so I wrote this in terms of, you know, joint CDFs, joint PMF. We could also write something like conditional. That is independence means you don't have the distribution of y given that x equals something.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDdx6xUOcs#t=2183.52s
Lecture 4: Conditional Probability | Statistics 110	So if we have two events, A and B, we say that they're independent-- we're assuming that we have a sample space and a probability function P that we're working with. So it's within the context of one experiment and one probability, P, that satisfies the axioms we've been talking about.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7NE4WF8j-Q#t=655.78s
Lecture 4: Conditional Probability | Statistics 110	Because that's a common mistake, and that's a terrible, disastrous blunder. This is a completely different from disjointness. If I say that A and B are disjoint, that means that if A occurred then B cannot possibly occur.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7NE4WF8j-Q#t=721.24s
Lecture 4: Conditional Probability | Statistics 110	That's opposite to independence. Independence says, if we know that A occurs, it tells us nothing whatsoever about whether B occurs. Disjointness says, if A occur, then B can't occur. So they're completely different concepts.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7NE4WF8j-Q#t=743.56s
Lecture 26: Conditional Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	So one way out out it, could we just say, well, on average, there's an infinite amount of money, and then you're pretty happy, right? But there are not many kinda like the Saint Petersburg paradox, where the expected value is infinity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgawcWisb0I#t=296.746s
Lecture 26: Conditional Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	So let's just let I be the indicator random variable. I is the indicator of which envelope has more money, so we could say I is one, if y equals 2x, and zero otherwise, or we could define it the other way around.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgawcWisb0I#t=479.71s
Lecture 26: Conditional Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	We can either talk about X and I or talk about Y and I. They're dependent, and that seems surprising at first. So let's think about what that means. It says that if you got to observe X, then somehow that gives information about I.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgawcWisb0I#t=512.76s
Lecture 26: Conditional Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	But we'll look at a DNA sequence which is the sequence that's drawn from the alphabet ACTG. And a lot of times, in genetics these days, you won't necessarily study certain patterns, right, they call motifs, where the pattern appear in the DNA sequence and you get similar problems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgawcWisb0I#t=1649.75s
Lecture 26: Conditional Expectation Continued | Statistics 110	But therefore, since conditional expectation is defined in terms of conditional probability, conditional expectations are expectations. It satisfies the same properties such as linearity So linearity is still true. Okay, so now let's just think about, what does this thing actually mean? E(X|X), that's easy, that's X, right, what else could it be? I know X and I want to predict X, I'm gonna use X as my prediction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgawcWisb0I#t=2394.28s
Lecture 19: Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions | Statistics 110	But there's much much more that we need to study about what happens when we have two random variables. Or a list, a sequence of random variables. Things like that. A sum of a million random variables, and things like that.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70dP_AECzQ#t=50.43s
Lecture 19: Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions | Statistics 110	Which looks complicated, especially if you haven't seen partial derivatives. But even if you haven't ever done partial derivatives before there's nothing really to worry about with this. All it means is take the derivative, this is a function of two variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70dP_AECzQ#t=171.245s
Lecture 19: Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions | Statistics 110	And at least I can think more geometrically. But anyway, conceptually it's analogous. The joint PDF is what we integrate to get the probability of any of xy being in any particular set, right? In one dimension we'd say, what's the probability of x is between -3 and 5, right? We want an interval.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70dP_AECzQ#t=342.23s
Lecture 19: Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions | Statistics 110	I call it the chicken and egg problem. Chicken-egg, We already had a homework problem about chickens and eggs, and hatchings and so on. But it's not exactly the same as this problem, it's related.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70dP_AECzQ#t=2402.622s
Lecture 19: Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions | Statistics 110	But we haven't yet proven whether they are independent of not cuz this is equal N. So now let's find the joint PMF. So just by definition the joint PMF is the probability that X equals something, lets say i, Y equals j, could use little x little y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70dP_AECzQ#t=2593.971s
Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110	With probability 0, so something really crazy could happen. But we don't worry too much about it, because it has probability 0. With probability 1, this is the sample mean, and it says that the sample mean converges to the true mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OprNqnHsVIA#t=164.152s
Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110	The gambler's fallacy is the idea that like let's say your gambling and you lose like ten times in a row and then it's the feeling that your due to win. You lost all these times then and you might try to justify that using a lot of large numbers and say well you know the coin might landed let's say, heads you win money, tails you lose money, you just lost money ten times in a row.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OprNqnHsVIA#t=435.66s
Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110	I don't really like the terminology strong and weak here, but that's kind of a standard. Strong law of large numbers is what I just said, where it's converging point-wise with probability 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OprNqnHsVIA#t=657.62s
Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110	That is just these random variables converged to this constant, except on some bad event that has probability 0. The weak law of large numbers says that for any, C greater than 0, the probability that Xn bar minus the mean is greater than c goes to 0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OprNqnHsVIA#t=673.583s
Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110	Normal approximation, I'll say binomial approximated by normal, the normal approximation to the binomial. When is that valid? To contrast it with the Poisson approximation, that we've seen before, okay? So, if x is, let's x be binomial np And as we've done many times before we can represent x as a sum of iid Bernoulli.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OprNqnHsVIA#t=2378.557s
Math 20 Section 1.2	The sum is the answer to an addition problem, the difference is the answer to a subtraction problem. A polygon is simply sided figure, poly means many, so it's just simply a many sided shape.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfqWReNt6po#t=20.836s
Math 20 Section 1.2	And then, parameter is the distance the outside of a shape or an object. Okay. Let's start with looking at objective number one, which is find the sum of two or more whole numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfqWReNt6po#t=36.056s
Math 20 Section 2.1	The key vocabulary word in section 2.1 is divisible. Divisible basically means it goes into. So we have some simple tests that we have some rules here for to check to see if a number is divisible by these numbers here.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcPZy6p2UN4#t=5.15s
Math 20 Section 2.1	Three goes into six therefore three goes in and is even, therefore six will go into our problem. Nine, sum of the digits divisible by nine. Well they only added up to six so nine won't go into six, so six is the only one of those two numbers that will go in evenly into a hundred and fourteen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcPZy6p2UN4#t=471.529s
Math 20 Section 1.4	The vocabulary for section one point four includes the word dividend, which is the numbers being divided. divisor is the number we're dividing into the dividend, and the quotient, which is the answer.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7F64zpxX6k#t=0.799s
Math 20 Section 7.5	Section seven-five has to do with volume. And volume is the amount of space something takes up like you're filling it up. So the formulas for volume for a cube or a rectangle, solid, is going to be length times width times heighths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N9GbdE5bdk#t=4.62s
Math 20 Section 2.4	So of the first one hundred numbers if you put your list out to a hundred, there would be twenty-five prime numbers. It means those are numbers that only one and itself are factors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9EOIzdMMZ0#t=237.189s
Math 20 Section 2.3	Section two point three it's main idea is to talk about factors. In factors are numbers that go into another number. Let's say we're going to list the factors of say, twenty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si5Y7Q_rszI#t=4.98s
Math 20 Section1.3	vocabulary for section one point three are factors which are the numbers being multiplied in a multiplication problem, so if you were multiplying two times three, the factors are going to be the two and the three.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlMtQoJVoYY#t=1.409s
Math 20 Section 1.2a	This section is getting ready for Algebra goes along with page thirty two and the vocabulary words are equation which is a statement involving variables and whole numbers. and then another vocabulary word is variable like an x or an a in the problem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GwCk-c0Fe4#t=0.829s
Math 95 6.6	So we could talk about like similar rectangles. Similar means that they're proportional to each other. So if I draw two rectangles, and I say that these rectangles are similar, even though they don't look very similar, what I'm saying, if this is R1 and this is R2, is that you could multiply R1 by some constant and you would get R2.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65QadyopU3s#t=534.406s
Math 95 6.1	So what does domain mean again? Recall that domain is all possible inputs, which are usually our X values if we're using X and Y. So if we have F of X equals 1 over X plus 2 and we're trying to figure out what are all the possible X values, well, there's going to be an infinite number of values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr2dXPb3QIs#t=156.796s
Math 95 6.3	Twelve is the smallest number that 4 and 3 go into evenly. And so what this means is that we need to make the denominator 12. In order to make 4 12 we're going to multiply it by 3, right? And whatever you do to the bottom you must do to the top, so we'll multiply the top also by 3.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BjeuxFiPjM#t=86.926s
math 95 7.6	You can have just an I left, but anything other than that, you want to simplify further. Okay. So that is multiplying and then we have dividing, which kind of goes back to what we had with the radicals, where we didn't ever want a radical in the denominator, we don't ever want an I in the denominator.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkDWXpERFBI#t=826.886s
math 95 7.5	"What you can do is introduce what we call extraneous solutions which means that there's solutions that are somewhat like posers. I like to say, ""Are they -- they're acting as solutions,"" but then they don't really work out."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW-5o8JwnTg#t=125.006s
Degrees of Freedom and Effect Sizes: Crash Course Statistics #28	This can happen in statistics, too. Occasionally we have to give up some freedom--degrees of freedom--in order to do something useful with our data. Degrees of freedom are the number of independent pieces of information we have and Degrees of freedom are an important part of many of the models that we use.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm0vFoGVMB8#t=39.19s
Degrees of Freedom and Effect Sizes: Crash Course Statistics #28	Degrees of freedom can help us measure that accuracy. We choose our t-distribution based on the number of degrees of freedom that we have. Degrees of freedom are the number of pieces of independent information in our data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm0vFoGVMB8#t=151.3s
Degrees of Freedom and Effect Sizes: Crash Course Statistics #28	So, this vitamin has what we call a small effect size. Effect size tells us how big the effect we observed was, compared to random variation. It’s really important to pair our p-values with effect sizes, because sometimes, we can get statistically significant effects, but effect sizes that are so small, they don’t really matter to us.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm0vFoGVMB8#t=530.98s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to Crash Course, Statistics. If you’ve ever seen a face in an onion, or a grilled cheese, or any other inanimate object, you’ve experienced pareidolia, which is a product of our brains that causes us to see the pattern of a face in non-face objects.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=2.84s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	Statisticians talk about two types of probability: empirical, and theoretical. Empirical probability is something we observe in actual data, like the ratio of girls in each individual family. It has some uncertainty, because like the samples in experiments, it’s just a small amount of the data that is available.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=57.94s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	Empirical probabilities, like sample statistics, give us a glimpse at the true theoretical probability, but they won’t always be equal to it because of the uncertainty and randomness of any sample. The theoretical probability on the other hand, is more of an ideal or a truth out there in the universe that we can’t directly see.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=75.52s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	So, we can use the simplified addition rule which says that the probability of getting a Red or Purple Skittle is the sum of the probability of getting a Red, and the probability of getting a purple.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=169.54s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	Since P(tails or 6) ≠ 0, these two events are not mutually exclusive, and we’ll need to adjust our addition rule accordingly. The full version of the addition rule states that P(tails or 6) = P(tails) + P(6) - P(tails and 6).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=228.489s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	In this simple case, we could easily see what the probability of tails and 6 is, but sometimes it’s not so easy to figure out. That’s why we have the Multiplication Rule, which helps us figure out the probability of two or more things happening at the same time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=299.62s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	Cole doesn’t have any secret knowledge about when it’s Free Ice Cream Night, so it has never affected his decision to come. Two events are considered independent if the probability of one event occurring is not changed by whether or not the second event occurred.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=419.39s
Probability Part 1: Rules and Patterns: Crash Course Statistics #13	But sometimes the results of the screenings are wrong. Either they can say there’s something abnormal when there isn’t (called a false positive) or that everything is all clear when it’s really not (called a false negative).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58#t=500.18s
Science Journalism: Crash Course Statistics #11	Take what gets called “text neck”-- a condition that includes sore neck muscles from looking down at your phone and laptop all the time. A Google Scholar search for Academic articles about “Text Neck” returns over 180 results and that’s only since 2013.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwqOoD17_LU#t=272.12s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	Usually this means using a random number generator to pick who gets the survey. We do Simple Random Sampling so that there’s no pattern or system for selecting respondents and each respondent has an equal chance of being selected.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=258.38s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	For example, telephone surveys often use Random Digit Dialing which selects 7 random digits and dials them. When someone picks up, they’re asked to take a survey. But here’s where we hit our first issue.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=270.05s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	If people aren’t forced to respond to the survey, we might experience something called Non-Response Bias in which the people who are most likely to complete a survey are systematically different from those who don’t.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=279.99s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	This is also related to Voluntary Response Bias in which people who choose to respond to voluntary surveys they see on Facebook...or Twitter... are people who again, are different than the broad population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=320.3s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	Stratified Random Sampling is another option. It splits the population into groups of interest and randomly selects people from each of the “stratas” so that each group in the overall sample is represented appropriately.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=419.6s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	Instead they use Cluster Sampling which create clusters (not Honey Nut Clusters) that are naturally occuring (like schools, or cities) and randomly select a few clusters to survey instead of randomly selecting individuals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=457.92s
Sampling Methods and Bias with Surveys: Crash Course Statistics #10	There are also non-experimental data collection methods like a Census. A Census is a survey that samples an ENTIRE population. The United States conducts a Census every 10 years, with the next one scheduled to be done in 2020.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-fIpB4D50#t=507.48s
ANOVA Part 2: Dealing with Intersectional Groups: Crash Course Statistics #34	Then once we know the total variation in the data set, we set out to use manufacturer and color to explain why these sedans have different prices. Our proposed model looks something like this: Which tells us that we think the price of a car is some baseline cost plus an adjustment for who made the car and what color it is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo1xlefg5KI#t=101.179s
ANOVA Part 2: Dealing with Intersectional Groups: Crash Course Statistics #34	We’re going to use our model and the error to create F statistics for each part of our model, as well as the model as a whole. The F-statistic is a ratio between the scaled Sums of Squares for a variable and the scaled Sums of Squares for the Error.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo1xlefg5KI#t=132.909s
ANOVA Part 2: Dealing with Intersectional Groups: Crash Course Statistics #34	Effect sizes try to tell us how large an effect is compared to how much variation we generally expect. In a t-test, we recognize that a new negotiating technique that only increases salaries by about $2 a year is not that exciting because people’s salaries generally vary way more than $2 a year.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo1xlefg5KI#t=220.88s
ANOVA Part 2: Dealing with Intersectional Groups: Crash Course Statistics #34	But occasionally we’ll see other significant effects. Single variables, like Bottle Type and Expertise, are called main effects. Statistically significant main effects are important, but when you interpret them, you need to do so with caution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo1xlefg5KI#t=609.11s
Correlation Doesn’t Equal Causation: Crash Course Statistics #8	The line--called a regression line--is the line as close as possible to all the points at the same time. And note here Pearson used feet and inches in his paper so we will too.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g#t=140.25s
Correlation Doesn’t Equal Causation: Crash Course Statistics #8	If I decided to measure the Son’s height in meters, the m...or slope... will change, even though the relationship didn’t. When we see a non-zero slope--also called a regression coefficient--it’s a sign that there’s some kind of relationship between our two variables, but that’s pretty much all it tells us.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g#t=205.79s
Correlation Doesn’t Equal Causation: Crash Course Statistics #8	We don’t know how strong that relationship is. For more information, we need to look at correlation. Correlation measures the way two variables move together, both the direction and closeness of their movement.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g#t=224.12s
Correlation Doesn’t Equal Causation: Crash Course Statistics #8	The Nic Cage data was provided to the city by Tyler Vigen. So as of today, our mayor has enacted the Cool-Cage act which will prohibit sale of air conditioners and create a Nicolas Cage task force who will do everything-- to prevent Nicolas Cage from starring in any movies.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g#t=520.49s
Probability Part 2: Updating Your Beliefs with Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #14	Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to Crash Course Statistics. We ended the last episode by talking about Conditional Probabilities which helped us find the probability of one event, given that a second event had already happened.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZCskBpHWyk#t=3.1s
Probability Part 2: Updating Your Beliefs with Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #14	But now I want to give you a better idea of why this is true and how this formula--with a few small tweaks--has revolutionized the field of statistics. INTRO In general terms, Conditional Probability says that the probability of an event, B, given that event A has already happened, is the probability of A and B happening together, Divided by the probability of A happening - that’s the general formula, but let’s give you a concrete example so we can visualize it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZCskBpHWyk#t=16.24s
Probability Part 2: Updating Your Beliefs with Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #14	Bayes Theorem states that: The probability of B given A, is equal to the Probability of A given B times the Probability of B all divided by the Probability of A You can see that this is just one step away from our conditional probability formula.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZCskBpHWyk#t=158.66s
Probability Part 2: Updating Your Beliefs with Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #14	We can also compare that probability to the probability that you just got a perfectly valid email about Nigerian Princes. If you just tried to guess your odds of an email being spam based on the rate of spam to non-spam email, you’d be missing some pretty useful information--the actual words in the email! Bayesian statistics is all about UPDATING your beliefs based on new information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZCskBpHWyk#t=209.689s
Randomness: Crash Course Statistics #17	But not everything...there’s still more to know about random processes, like how spread out or how variable they are. Variance is also an expectation. It tells us how spread out we expect the data to be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9en6NvQfk#t=336.34s
Randomness: Crash Course Statistics #17	Variance is the expectation of all data points minus the mean squared. Since we’re subtracting the mean, we call it mean-centered or “central”. In essence, we’re creating a new distribution (each value minus the mean squared) , and taking the expectation of this new distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9en6NvQfk#t=359.88s
Randomness: Crash Course Statistics #17	We’ve already covered the first two, but the third moment--the expectation of the mean centered data to the third power--is also something you might be familiar with: Skewness. Skewness tells us whether there are more extreme values on one side, like income or amount won in Vegas which are both right skewed.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9en6NvQfk#t=426.17s
Randomness: Crash Course Statistics #17	Numbers smaller than the mean that are negative will still be negative when they’re taken to the third power. So the third moment--skewness-- is a measure of how skewed the distribution is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9en6NvQfk#t=478.74s
Randomness: Crash Course Statistics #17	And finally, the Fourth moment - Kurtosis. Kurtosis is the Expectation of the mean centered data to the fourth power. And it’s a measure of how thick the tails on a distribution are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9en6NvQfk#t=532.71s
The Replication Crisis: Crash Course Statistics #31	To make sure that an experimental result is sound, we want to replicate the findings. Results need to be confirmed. Which is why replication--re-running studies to confirm results --and reproducible analysis--the ability for other scientists to repeat the analyses you did on your data--are essential in science.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzEGSm23y8#t=30.3s
The Replication Crisis: Crash Course Statistics #31	So, what’s causing science’s replication problem? There are a lot of answers. Some of them involve unscrupulous researchers--researchers that are more concerned with attention and publishing and splashy headlines than good science.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzEGSm23y8#t=152.55s
The Replication Crisis: Crash Course Statistics #31	We need to find more funding for replication studies and change the way we all view the value of replication. Some people call for more publication of “null results”--those that DON’T support the hypothesis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzEGSm23y8#t=435.0s
The Replication Crisis: Crash Course Statistics #31	Let’s just look at one area of research we’ve talked about before: Social Priming -- the idea that certain actions or conditions can affect the way you behave. One famous case of social priming is a study where subjects who were exposed to words related to old age--like Florida, bingo, grey, or retired--walked more slowly after exposure than those who were shown neutral words.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzEGSm23y8#t=498.8s
The Replication Crisis: Crash Course Statistics #31	In those studies, there were actual effects of social priming. There you can see our true positives (60) and false negatives (40). So what does that mean? Well, remember, statistical power is the ability to detect real effects.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzEGSm23y8#t=576.28s
The Replication Crisis: Crash Course Statistics #31	They refine results. Build on other people’s findings. Replication is an essential part of the path to scientific progress and real breakthroughs. The reproducibility crisis means more people are taking the replication step of the process seriously.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBzEGSm23y8#t=781.779s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	You’ve likely heard it called the average--though all of these measures are sometimes called “averages”. Some people call it the “expectation” of a set of data. The mean...or average...takes the sum of all the numbers in a data set, and divides by the number of data points.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=88.659s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	The mean is good at measuring things that are relatively “normally” distributed. “Normal” means a distribution of data that has roughly the same amount of data on either side of the middle, and has its most common values around the middle of the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=142.36s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	Data that are distributed normally will have a symmetrical bell shape that you’ve probably seen before. A distribution shows us how often each value occurs in our data set, which is also known as their frequency.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=155.12s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	In the 13th century a male who lived to 30--was likely to make it into his fifties! To give unusually large or small values, also called outliers, less influence on our measure of where the center of our data is, we can use the median.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=223.45s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	Just like the most popular and fashionable trends, the mode is the most popular value. But not popular like Despacito. When we refer to the “mode” of our data, we mean the value that appears most in our data set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=398.74s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	Bimodal data is an example of “Multimodal” data which has many values that are similarly common. Usually multimodal data results from two or more underlying groups all being measured together. In the case of our book, the two groups were the “love it” five-star group, and the “hate it” one-star group.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=425.59s
Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3	Statisticians say the normal distribution has zero skew, since the mean and median are the same. When the median and mean are different, a distribution is skewed, which is a way of saying that there are some unusually extreme values on one side of our distribution, either large or small in our data set.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM#t=520.089s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	These activation functions improve the way many neural networks learn, and give them more flexibility to model complex relationships between input and output. One common activation function is called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) --which turns all negative values to 0, and leaves positive ones as they are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=144.62s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	This makes these nodes act a little bit like neurons in your brain--hence the name neural network-- which require a certain “threshold” of activation before they’ll fire. So a node with 0 doesn’t fire, or contribute to the output at all.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=161.02s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	You can think of all the calculations that happen between the input nodes and output nodes as something called “feature generation”. “Feature” is just a fancy word for a variable that can be made up of a combination of other variables.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=194.76s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	For example we could use your grades, attendance, and test scores to create a “Feature” called Academic Performance. Essentially the neural network is taking the variables we give it, and performing combinations and calculations to create new values, or “features”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=206.76s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	If a neural network has more than one layer, we say that we’re using “Deep Learning”, since there are many layers of nodes. Deep Learning has gained popularity in recent years. Neural networks and deep learning have been used extensively to do things like recognize handwritten numbers and simulate x-ray images so airport security can be trained to recognize items like drugs and guns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=242.02s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	You can see that in this neural network--sometimes called a Feed Forward Neural Network--all the nodes only feed into the next layer from input to output. Hence, they only Feed information Forward.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=286.46s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	But the further you get through the sentence, the less influence the word “A” has. Unlike Feed Forward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks “ remember “ the previous outputs. For example, if we used a Recurrent Neural Networks to generate a melody, we would give the network some information about our song framework, and we’d ask it for a note.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=344.819s
Neural Networks: Crash Course Statistics #41	The more complex these networks are, the more data they need to perform well. But some neural networks can be trained to generate data. These are called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). They use sets of existing data to try to learn how to create new data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBlm4wnjNMY#t=547.47s
P-Hacking: Crash Course Statistics #30	Hacked. P hacked. P-hacking is manipulating data or analyses to artificially get significant p-values. Today we’re going to take a break from learning new statistical models, and instead look at some statistics gone wrong.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0fAjNHb1M#t=21.78s
P-Hacking: Crash Course Statistics #30	And maybe also some props gone wrong. INTRO To recap to calculate a p-value, we look at the Null Hypothesis--which is the idea that there’s no effect. This can be no effect of shoe color on the number of steps you walked today, or no effect of grams of fat in your diet on energy levels.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0fAjNHb1M#t=36.97s
P-Hacking: Crash Course Statistics #30	P-hacking is when analyses are being chosen based on what makes the p-value significant, not what’s the best analysis plan. Statistical tests that look normal on the surface may have been p-hacked.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0fAjNHb1M#t=129.66s
You Know I’m All About that Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #24	Our beliefs are numerous, sometimes complex, and consistently changing. So it can be useful to have a way of doing statistical inference that reflects that. INTRO Bayes’ Theorem--or Bayes Rule--tells us the that probability of A given B, is the probability of B given A times the probability of A, all divided by the probability of B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k#t=49.04s
You Know I’m All About that Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #24	Her heart starts beating a little faster! This ratio of the probability of our information under one hypothesis--that he’s a fan--compared to another--that he’s not a fan--is called a Bayes’ Factor. It represents the amount of information that we’ve learned about our hypotheses from the data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k#t=279.4s
You Know I’m All About that Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #24	So we’re really looking at the ratio of two calculations of Bayes’ Theorem because we’re comparing two posterior probabilities. Luckily, the probability of having seen the latest Star Wars movie is the same in both equations, so it cancels out and we end up with this: In Bayesian Statistics, these things are called: the Prior--what you believed before you saw any evidence the likelihood--a measure of how much your evidence should change your prior beliefs And the Posterior--what you believe after you’ve seen the evidence In a more general form we can say that after we see the data, how likely one hypothesis is compared to the other is equal to the ratio of how likely we thought these hypotheses were before we got any evidence, adjusted by the evidence with which the data provided us.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k#t=367.779s
You Know I’m All About that Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #24	So your new, posterior beliefs are more affected by the evidence than your prior beliefs. Bayesian hypothesis testing provides a structured way to quantify a logical process that we do every day, incorporating new events into the way that we see the world.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k#t=619.62s
What Is Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #1	Statistics is all about making sense of data--and figuring out how to put that information to use. Today, we’re going to answer the question “What IS Statistics?” INTRO The legend says that during a late 1920’s English tea at Cambridge, a woman claimed that a cup of tea with milk added last tasted different than tea where the milk was added first.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQaBpKfDRk#t=49.22s
What Is Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #1	Just in case you were curious. At this point, it’s worth mentioning that there are two related--but separate--meanings of the word statistics. We can refer to the field of statistics... which is the study and practice of collecting and analyzing data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQaBpKfDRk#t=145.099s
What Is Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #1	How about now? Still not sure? It is a pretty small difference right]? Inferential statistics give you the ability to test how likely it is that the two populations we sampled actually have different IQ increases.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQaBpKfDRk#t=537.43s
What Is Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #1	Descriptive statistics make` the data we get more digestible, even though we lose information about individual data points. Inferential statistics can help us make decisions about data when there’s uncertainty (like whether Smartie-vite actually will increase your IQ).	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQaBpKfDRk#t=616.16s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	Many types of Machine Learning (ML) do just that: build models to predict future outcomes. And this field has exploded over the past few decades. Supervised Machine Learning takes data that already has a correct answer, like images that have been labeled as “cat” or “not a cat”, or the current salary of a company’s CEO, and tries to learn how to predict it. It’s supervised because we can tell the model what it got wrong.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=32.18s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	The other portion, called the testing set, is the data we’re pretending is from the future. We don’t use it to train our model. Instead, to test how well our model works, we withhold the outcomes of the test set so that the model doesn’t know whether someone paid off their loan or not, and ask it to make a prediction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=183.819s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	Then, we can compare these with the real outcomes that we ignored before. We can do this using a what’s called a Confusion Matrix. A Confusion Matrix is a chart that tells us what actually happened--whether a person paid back a loan--and what the model predicted would happen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=197.49s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	The diagonals of this matrix are times when the model got it right. Cases where the model correctly predicted that the person will default on the loan is called a True Positive.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=213.659s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	“True” because it got it right. “Positive” because the person defaulted on their loan. Cases where the model correctly predicted that a person will pay back the loan are called True Negatives.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=223.16s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	Again “true” because it made the correct prediction, and “negative” because the person did not default. Cases where the model was wrong are called False Negatives--if the model thought that they would not default--and False Positives--if the model thought they would default.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=235.769s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	Accuracy is the total number of correct classifications--Our True Positives and True Negatives--divided by the total number of cases. It’s the percent of cases our model got correct. Accuracy is important. But it’s also pretty simplistic. It doesn’t take into account the fact that in different situations, we might care more about some mistakes than others.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=259.39s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	Another common model is Linear Discriminant Analysis or LDA for short. LDA uses Bayes’ Theorem in order to help us make predictions about data. Let’s say we wanna predict whether someone would get into our local state college based on their high school GPA.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=295.15s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	We want to create a score, we’ll call it Score X, that’s a linear combination of GPA and SAT scores. Something like this: We, or rather the computer, want to make it so that the Score X value of the admitted students is as different as possible from the Score X value of the people who weren’t admitted.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=360.339s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	So if 5 million potential students ask you to predict whether they get in, using LDA to simplify will speed things up. Reducing the number of variables we have to deal with is called Dimensionality Reduction, and it’s really important in the world of “Big Data”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=443.95s
Supervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #36	In practice it is a tiny bit more complicated than that. One thing we need to do is decide how many “neighboring” data points to look at. The K in KNN is a variable representing the number of neighbors we’ll look at for each point--or dog--we want to classify.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmLid2x9eKg#t=504.569s
Chi-Square Tests: Crash Course Statistics #29	Turns out a chi-square model fits like that perfect pair of jeans. INTRO Back in one of our data visualization episodes, we talked about frequency tables, which tell you the counts--or frequencies--of different categories.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug#t=37.18s
Chi-Square Tests: Crash Course Statistics #29	But chi-square tests aren’t limited to analyzing just ONE categorical variable. They can even handle TWO. Like with the Test of Independence, the second type of chi-square test. Tests of independence look to see whether being a member of one category is independent of the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug#t=364.08s
Chi-Square Tests: Crash Course Statistics #29	For example, let’s look at the annual NerdFighteria Survey -- a survey that Hank and John Green request their audience of nerdfighters take every year. We wanted to take a look at the two most important questions they asked last year: what Hogwarts houses nerdfighters were in AND if they liked pineapple on pizza.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug#t=380.069s
Chi-Square Tests: Crash Course Statistics #29	And you’ll soon see that the calculations we do here are the exact same for the third Chi-Square test: the Chi-Square test of Homogeneity. Test of homogeneity are looking at whether it’s likely that different samples come from the same population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug#t=448.889s
Regression: Crash Course Statistics #32	General Linear Models take the information that data give us and portion it out into two major parts: information that can be accounted for by our model, and information that can’t be.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWqE7YHR4Jc#t=110.74s
Regression: Crash Course Statistics #32	Our model will look something like this: The first thing we want to do is plot our datafrom 100 videos: This allows us to check whether we think that the data is best fit by a straight line, and look for outliers--those are points that are really extreme compared to the rest of our data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWqE7YHR4Jc#t=147.29s
Regression: Crash Course Statistics #32	A regression line is the straight line that’s as close as possible to all the data points at once. That means that it’s the one straight line that minimizes the sum of the squared distance of each point to the line.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWqE7YHR4Jc#t=219.6s
Regression: Crash Course Statistics #32	Sums of Squares for Regression represents the proportion of that information that we can explain using the model we created. And Sums of Squares for Error represents the leftover information--the portion of Total Sums of Squares that the model can’t explain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWqE7YHR4Jc#t=511.39s
Plots, Outliers, and Justin Timberlake: Data Visualization Part 2: Crash Course Statistics #6	That’s why it’s called “cumulative.” It’s the frequency of all the points we’ve accumulated up to this point. It’s like a small fish getting eaten by a bigger fish, which gets eaten by an even bigger fish, and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMkllhBI91Y#t=571.38s
Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskegee Experiment, and Ethical Data Collection: Crash Course Statistics #12	Most research institutions have a committee, called the Institutional Review Board-- IRB--which oversees all the research at that institution to make sure that it’s ethical. “Voluntariness” is one of the most important things that they check for.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzNANZnoiRs#t=153.7s
Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskegee Experiment, and Ethical Data Collection: Crash Course Statistics #12	One of the main tenets is beneficence, which not only requires that researchers minimize the potential for risk to subjects, but also requires that the risk should be outweighed by potential benefits to the patient and the scientific community.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzNANZnoiRs#t=344.8s
Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskegee Experiment, and Ethical Data Collection: Crash Course Statistics #12	Our last story here isn’t real but it illustrates the complexities of research ethics in the digital age. In the seventh season of the hit show Parks and Recreation, a giant internet corporation comes to the small town of Pawnee, Indiana, to offer free Wifi to the entire city.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzNANZnoiRs#t=389.08s
Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskegee Experiment, and Ethical Data Collection: Crash Course Statistics #12	So how did the internet company know what each person would want? It turns out that the free WiFi came with a pretty high cost, privacy. In exchange for the free WiFi the internet company, Gryzzl, was collecting all data that was transferred over their Network, this gets called Data Mining.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzNANZnoiRs#t=431.26s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	Randomness allows us to claim that before the cappuccino makers were given out, there were no systematic differences between the groups. Usually researchers will use a random number generator to assign subjects into random groups.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=176.02s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	Random assignment reduces the chance that the bias of the people running the experiment will affect the groups. For example, it prevents them from doing things like putting subjects who they think will respond to caffeine in the cappuccino group, and those who won’t in the no-cappuccino group.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=188.86s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	It’s been shown that just the act of taking a fake medication or having a fake surgery-- seriously --can make people feel better. These are called placebo effects. Placebos allow us to control these effects by “pretending” to treat everyone.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=360.08s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	People can see what they’re eating. When subjects don’t know which treatment they’re receiving--usually because they’re getting a good placebo--they are considered “blind” to the treatment. An Experiment where the subjects don’t know what treatment they’re getting but the researchers do is called a Single Blind Study, which leads to better experiments because all groups experience the act of being treated.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=439.349s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	We try to solve this problem by having Double Blind studies in which both the subjects and the researchers have no idea which treatment the subject is getting. Just like with blinding patients, sometimes it’s impossible for the researcher to not be able to tell the difference, but double blind studies are the gold standard in many fields whenever they are physically ….and financially…. doable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=515.74s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	And while we still can’t bend space and time to make parallel universes, there are a few other ways to pretend we do have them. One is Matched-Pairs experiments. Just like the name implies, these experiments use pairs of subjects that are very similar, and give one of them Treatment A, and the other Treatment B.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=536.12s
Controlled Experiments: Crash Course Statistics #9	The more similar the groups are before treatment, the better researchers can spot treatment effects. We can also have a matched-pairs experiment with non-twins. In this case, each pair is matched on one or more features that the researchers decide are important... like age, race, gender, or weight.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY#t=568.37s
Fitting Models Is like Tetris: Crash Course Statistics #35	ANOVAs allow us to analyze the effect of variables with two or more groups on continuous variables. And regressions allow us to analyze two continuous variables. General Linear Models explain the data we observe by building a model to predict that data, and then keeping track of how close the prediction is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdmG6uUtB4o#t=55.469s
Fitting Models Is like Tetris: Crash Course Statistics #35	We can now build a model to predict milliliters of anesthesia based on hair color and weight. Just like its friends, regression and ANOVA, the ANCOVA looks at the overall variation in the data, and uses different variables, like hair color and weight, to explain it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdmG6uUtB4o#t=139.519s
Fitting Models Is like Tetris: Crash Course Statistics #35	This makes our pile of error variation smaller. For this reason, many researchers will add covariates--continuous variables that are used to explain our outcome variable--not only for inference, but also to reduce the amount of error variation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdmG6uUtB4o#t=303.27s
Fitting Models Is like Tetris: Crash Course Statistics #35	And we can do that with more than 2 groups as well, using something called a Repeated Measures ANOVA. A Repeated Measures ANOVA asks whether there’s a significant difference between 2 or more groups or conditions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdmG6uUtB4o#t=447.27s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	But they also include some very important context: a measure of “average” variation we’d expect to see, like how much novice or pro swimmers differ. Test statistics help us quantify whether data fits our null hypothesis well.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=140.62s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	A z-score is a test statistic. Let’s look at a simple example. Say your IQ is 130. You’re so smart. And the population mean is 100. On average we expect someone to be about 15 points from the mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=152.48s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	But also a sampling distribution which is the distribution of all possible group means for a certain sample size. You might remember we first learned about sampling distribution in episode 19. We often have questions about groups of people.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=178.34s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	Instead of taking an individual score and subtracting the population mean, we take a group mean and subtract the mean of our sampling distribution under the null hypothesis. Then we divide by the standard error, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=221.7s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	So, the z-score--also called the z-statistic--tells us how many standard errors away from the sampling distribution mean our group mean is. Z-statistics around 1 or -1 tell us that the sample mean is the typical distance we’d expect a typical sample mean to be from the mean of the null hypothesis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=236.94s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	There’s two main ways of telling whether this z-statistic, which is about 2.2295 in our case, represents a statistically significant result. The first way is to calculate a “critical” value. A critical value is a value of our test statistic that marks the limits of our “extreme” values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=373.43s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	A test statistic that is more extreme than these critical values (that is it’s towards the tails) causes us to reject the null . We calculate our critical value by finding out which test-statistic value corresponds to the top 0.5, 1, or 5% most extreme values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=391.59s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	We’d expect to see a difference of 0 if the null were true. Our measure of average variation is the standard error. The standard error is the typical distance that a sample mean will be from the population mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=573.08s
Test Statistics: Crash Course Statistics #26	Test statistics form the basis of how we can test if things are actually different or what we seeing is just normal variation. They help us know how likely it is that our results are normal, or if something interesting is going on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ7kgmhdIwA#t=699.749s
When Predictions Fail: Crash Course Statistics #43	We’re not bad at earthquake forecasting even if we struggle with accurate earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting focuses on the probabilities of earthquakes, usually over longer periods of time. It can also help predict likely effects and damage.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l60dMUhY5o#t=311.729s
When Predictions Fail: Crash Course Statistics #43	And earthquakes are not without some kind of pattern. They do tend to occur in clusters, with aftershocks following quakes in a pretty predictable pattern. But in his book The Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver warns about looking so hard at the data, that we see noise--random variation with no pattern--as a signal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l60dMUhY5o#t=344.71s
Big Data Problems: Crash Course Statistics #39	Judges in the U.S. use risk assessment programs while making sentencing decisions. A commonly-used one is COMPAS, which was created by the company Equivant. It basically gives a score of how likely a person is to commit another crime within two years.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im3GkAYUivE#t=170.55s
Big Data Problems: Crash Course Statistics #39	We have to supply it with good, unbiased data. Males who succeeded and failed, and females that succeeded and failed. In the tech world, you’ll often hear the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” which means that bad input will lead to bad output.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im3GkAYUivE#t=259.29s
Big Data Problems: Crash Course Statistics #39	The U.S. has The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which went into effect in 2000. It’s intended to protect the privacy of children under the age of thirteen. The Act basically requires websites and apps to get parental approval for the personal information it might collect from kids.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im3GkAYUivE#t=415.68s
Big Data Problems: Crash Course Statistics #39	This is called k-anonymity. K is the number of subjects who share the exact same characteristics. If there are two people with that disease from that city, we have 2-anonymity because there were 2 subjects with the same characteristics.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im3GkAYUivE#t=515.5s
Bayes in Science and Everyday Life: Crash Course Statistics #25	Science writer Sharon Bertsch McGrayne called it, “a Theorem in want of a computer...”. In fact for much of the 20th century, Scientists and Statisticians who wanted to use Bayes were limited in their ability to do so by a lack of computational power.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51bLRF02b4w#t=71.0s
Bayes in Science and Everyday Life: Crash Course Statistics #25	This is called the Bayes Factor when comparing two models. Once we’ve updated, our new beliefs are called our “Posterior” beliefs. If we’re comparing two models, they are called our posterior odds.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51bLRF02b4w#t=120.319s
Bayes in Science and Everyday Life: Crash Course Statistics #25	A pretend amnesiacs group - without DID who did not see the materials. And a maligners group without DID who saw the materials but were told to pretend they hadn’t and answer as if they had never heard the story or seen the pictures.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51bLRF02b4w#t=501.68s
Measures of Spread: Crash Course Statistics #4	These are the people who you appeal to the most. This might be better summarized by the InterQuartile Range (or IQR) which doesn’t consider extreme values. The IQR looks at the spread of the middle 50% of your data.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4yfNi_8Kqw#t=152.569s
The Shape of Data: Distributions: Crash Course Statistics #7	It’s not just mechanical stuff. It’s leaves and animals and even people. The distribution is what specifies how the knobs and dials on our machine are set. Once the machine is set, every time there’s a new tree, the machine pops out a random number of leaves from the distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPFNxD3Yg6U#t=123.31s
The Shape of Data: Distributions: Crash Course Statistics #7	The mean tells us where the center of the distribution is. The standard deviation tells us how thin or squished the normal distribution is. Since the standard deviation is the average distance between any point and the mean, the smaller it is the closer all the data will be to the mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPFNxD3Yg6U#t=242.99s
Confidence Intervals: Crash Course Statistics #20	A “confidence interval” is an estimated range of values that seem reasonable based on what we’ve observed. It’s center is still the sample mean, but we’ve got some room on either side for our uncertainty.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDEvXB6ApWc#t=67.18s
Confidence Intervals: Crash Course Statistics #20	Now that we know what a confidence interval is, it might be useful to calculate it. A 95% CI is the range that contains the middle 95% of the values of our estimated sampling distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDEvXB6ApWc#t=213.04s
Confidence Intervals: Crash Course Statistics #20	And to get that range, we can use a z-score. A z-score tells us the distance between the mean of a distribution and a data point in standard deviations. Previously, we’ve used z-scores to help us find percentiles.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDEvXB6ApWc#t=224.66s
Confidence Intervals: Crash Course Statistics #20	The t-distribution, like the z-distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that’s unimodal. It’s a useful way to represent sampling distributions. The t-distribution changes its shape according to how much information there is.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDEvXB6ApWc#t=430.48s
P-Value Problems: Crash Course Statistics #22	Then we calculate how often we’d see a value that is at least as extreme as our observed value. So in probability terms, the p-value is the probability of getting a sample as or more extreme than ours, given that the null hypothesis is true: So all the values that we see in the sampling distribution are means we could actually get if the null hypothesis was true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPD8lER8ju4#t=42.929s
Charts Are Like Pasta - Data Visualization Part 1: Crash Course Statistics #5	Maybe I’ll make an infographic of all the places we see data visualizations. INTRO There are two main types of data that we might encounter: categorical and quantitative. Quantitative data are quantities, numbers that have both order and consistent spacing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEWY6kkBdpo#t=24.38s
Charts Are Like Pasta - Data Visualization Part 1: Crash Course Statistics #5	A frequency table shows you all of the categories and the number of data points that fall in that category (in other words, its frequency). To change a frequency table into a relative frequency table, we just need to take each raw frequency and divide by the number of total points to get a decimal between 0 and 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEWY6kkBdpo#t=96.249s
The Binomial Distribution: Crash Course Statistics #15	A special case of the Binomial Distribution with only one trial--or just one event, a single coin flip, for example--is called the Bernoulli Distribution. It represents the probability of of getting either a success or a failure.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR0nMTr6uOo#t=552.32s
ANOVA: Crash Course Statistics #33	INTRO The GLM Framework takes all the information that our data contain, and partitions it into two piles: information that can be explained by a model that represents the way we think things work, and error, which is the amount of information that our model fails to explain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo#t=41.34s
ANOVA: Crash Course Statistics #33	We’re also going to need the amount of variation that it DOESN’T explain. In other words, how much ratings vary within each group of Cacao beans. So, we can sum up the squared differences between each data point and its group mean to get our Sums of Squares for Error: the amount of information that our model doesn’t explain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo#t=322.599s
ANOVA: Crash Course Statistics #33	The larger that F is, the more information our model is able to give us about our chocolate bar ratings. Again, SSM is the variation our model explains and SSE is the variation it doesn’t explain.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo#t=354.319s
ANOVA: Crash Course Statistics #33	Maybe Trinitario is significantly different from Criollo but not Forastero beans.. An F-test is an example of an Omnibus test, which means it’s a test that contains many items or groups. When we get a significant F-statistic, it means that there’s SOME statistically significant difference somewhere between the groups, but we still have to look for it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo#t=440.439s
ANOVA: Crash Course Statistics #33	And our computer spit out this: the degrees of freedom, sums of squares, mean squares, F-statistic, and p-value. This is called an ANOVA table and it organizes all the information our ANOVA models give us.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo#t=633.93s
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #37	Usually these are data points from your set, but they don’t have to be. Then, we treat these random points as the centers of our 3 groups. So we call them “centroids”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUn8k5zSI6g#t=113.57s
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #37	And here, converge means that the centroids and groups stop changing, even as you keep repeating these steps . Once it converges, you have your 3 groups, or clusters. We can then look at the clusters and decide which coupons to send.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUn8k5zSI6g#t=155.65s
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #37	It’s turtles I mean clusters all the way down. This graph of how the clusters are related to each other is called a dendrogram. The further up the dendrogram that two clusters join, the less similar they are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUn8k5zSI6g#t=372.11s
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Crash Course Statistics #37	The type of hierarchical clustering that we’ve been doing so far is called Agglomerative, or bottom-up clustering. That’s because all the data points start off as their own cluster, and are merged together until there’s only one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUn8k5zSI6g#t=569.379s
Z-Scores and Percentiles: Crash Course Statistics #18	A re-scaled score, which is called a z-score, of 1 indicates a point that is 1 standard deviation higher than the mean, and a z-score of -1 indicates a point that is 1 standard deviation lower than the mean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAxyI_XfqXk#t=169.459s
Z-Scores and Percentiles: Crash Course Statistics #18	In fact there’s an entire z-distribution that allows us to calculate things like percentiles. Percentiles tell you what percentage of the population has a score or value that’s lower than yours. The median, is the 50th percentile; exactly half the data is above and below it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAxyI_XfqXk#t=241.1s
Z-Scores and Percentiles: Crash Course Statistics #18	Then we add the mean score 2,000 to get the final score to beat: 2,495. We can also think of percentiles as the probability that a random score drawn from a z-distribution will be lower than a given score.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAxyI_XfqXk#t=386.139s
Mathematical Thinking: Crash Course Statistics #2	(It is. I looked it up.) Numeracy is about being able to wrap your head around what it means when politicians talk about a one-point-five-trillion-dollar budget hole. It’s about getting a handle on how much you should really lose sleep over the chance of an Ebola outbreak.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9Xl1AcSv8#t=55.12s
Mathematical Thinking: Crash Course Statistics #2	Mathematical thinking is about seeing the world in a different way. Which means sometimes seeing beyond our intuition or gut feeling. Because it turns out most of our guts are good at digesting food and pretty bad at math.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9Xl1AcSv8#t=81.48s
Playing with Power: P-Values Pt 3: Crash Course Statistics #23	P-values tell us how “rare” or “extreme” our sample data would be if it really did come from the null distribution. Null means nothing so null hypotheses tend to say that there’s no effect, or nothing’s going on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWagtGT1zH4#t=47.86s
Playing with Power: P-Values Pt 3: Crash Course Statistics #23	In two of these situations we make the correct decisions, and in the other two, we’d have made an error. The first error is called a Type I error, which is rejecting the null, even if it’s true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWagtGT1zH4#t=135.14s
Playing with Power: P-Values Pt 3: Crash Course Statistics #23	There’s often a trade off between Type I and Type II errors. Type I errors are essentially False positives: we think we’ve detected an effect, but there isn't one. And Type II errors are False negatives: there was an effect, we just didn’t see it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWagtGT1zH4#t=301.83s
Geometric Distributions and The Birthday Paradox: Crash Course Statistics #16	Geometric probabilities tell you the probability that your first success will be on your nth try.

When Predictions Succeed: Crash Course Statistics #44	One company that has shared a bit about its algorithms is StitchFix. It’s a style subscription service that sends you clothes to try on and potentially buy. StitchFix uses data and statistics in order to make sure that they choose clothes you’re more likely to wanna keep.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFdLKkuYc4#t=138.54s
When Predictions Succeed: Crash Course Statistics #44	This spurred on the popularity of Sabermetrics which is the statistical analysis of players and gameplay in baseball. Sabermetricians use statistics to figure out who to hire, who to trade, and when to pull pitchers from the mound.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFdLKkuYc4#t=266.48s
The Normal Distribution: Crash Course Statistics #19	One reason we talk so much about normal distributions is because distributions of means are normally distributed, even if populations aren’t. The normal distribution is symmetric, which means its mean, median and mode are all the same value. And it’s most popular values are in the middle, with skinny tails to either side.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBjft49MAO8#t=50.89s
The Normal Distribution: Crash Course Statistics #19	The reason that sampling distributions are almost always normal is laid out in the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means for an independent, random variable, will get closer and closer to a normal distribution as the size of the sample gets bigger and bigger, even if the original population distribution isn’t normal itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBjft49MAO8#t=157.15s
The Normal Distribution: Crash Course Statistics #19	We call The standard deviation of a sampling distribution the standard error so that we don’t get it confused with the population standard deviation, it’s still a standard deviation, just of a different distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBjft49MAO8#t=508.26s
The Normal Distribution: Crash Course Statistics #19	It might help if we had a measure of how different we expect one sample mean to be from the true mean, luckily we do: the standard error which tells us the average distance between a sample mean and the true mean of 16oz.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBjft49MAO8#t=544.46s
How P-Values Help Us Test Hypotheses: Crash Course Statistics #21	or whether the IQ of university students is actually different from the population. Today, we’re going to start a conversation about statistical inference, which tells us how we can go from describing data we already have to making inferences about data we don’t have.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf3egy7TQ2Q#t=13.549s
How P-Values Help Us Test Hypotheses: Crash Course Statistics #21	In situations like these, one common method of testing ideas is Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) You have a hypothesis. That people with a certain gene, we’ll call it gene X, eat a different amount of calories than the general population.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf3egy7TQ2Q#t=219.14s
How P-Values Help Us Test Hypotheses: Crash Course Statistics #21	Null Hypothesis Significance testing asks you to test a different hypothesis--which says there is no difference or effect of this gene. And we’ll see how well this null hypothesis predicts the data we’ve collected.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf3egy7TQ2Q#t=232.6s
How P-Values Help Us Test Hypotheses: Crash Course Statistics #21	Null Hypothesis Significance testing is a form of the reductio ad absurdum argument which tries to discredit an idea by assuming the idea is true, and then showing that if you make that assumption, something contradictory happens.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf3egy7TQ2Q#t=269.87s
Pi hiding in prime regularities	It’s a lot, but good math takes time, and we’ll take it step by step. When I say “lattice point”, I mean a point (a, b) in the plane where a and b are both integers, a point where grid lines cross. If you draw a circle centered at the origin, say with radius 10, how many lattice points would you guess are inside that circle? Well, there’s one lattice point for each unit of area, so the answer should be approximately equal to the area of the circle, pi*R2, which in this case is pi(102). And for a really big radius, like 1,000,000, you’d expect this to be more accurate, in the sense that the percent error between the estimate pi*R2 and the actual count of lattice points should get smaller. If you can find a second way to answer the same question, how many lattice points are in this circle, it might lead you to another way to express the area of a circle, and hence another way to express pi.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY#t=149.98s
Why is pi here?  And why is it squared?  A geometric answer to the Basel problem	That first lighthouse has some Apparent brightness from your point of view, some amount of energy that your eye is receiving from the light per unit time. And let's just call that a brightness of one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls#t=123.12s
Why do colliding blocks compute pi?	What we’ve drawn here is called a “phase diagram”, which is a simple but powerful idea in math where you encode the state of some system, in this case the velocities of our sliding blocks, as a single point in some abstract space. What’s powerful here is that it turns questions about dynamics into questions about geometry. In this case, the dynamical idea of all pairs of velocities that conserve energy corresponds to the geometric object of a circle, and counting the total number of collisions turns into counting the number of hops along these lines, alternating between vertical and diagonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE#t=367.99s
Why do colliding blocks compute pi?	The key here is to use the ever-helpful inscribed angle theorem, which says that whenever you form an angle using three points on a circle P1, P2 and P3 like this, it will be exactly half the angle formed by P1, the circle’s center, and P3. P2 can be anywhere on this circle, except in that arc between P1 and P3, and this fact will be true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE#t=436.36s
The essence of calculus	And we care about derivatives because they help us solve problems, and in our little exploration here, we already have a slight glimpse of one way that they're used. They are the key to solving integral questions, problems that require finding the area under a curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM#t=889.04s
The essence of calculus	"Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives, you'll be able to look at a situation like this one where you don't know what a function is but you do know that its derivative should be x squared and from that reverse engineer what the function must be. And this back and forth between integrals and derivatives where the derivative of a function for the area under a graph gives you back the function defining the graph itself is called the ""Fundamental theorem of calculus"". It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives, and it shows how, in some sense, each one is an inverse of the other."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM#t=904.32s
Taylor series | Chapter 11, Essence of calculus	To do that, make each coefficient of this polynomial follow this same pattern, but divide each one by the appropriate factorial, like I mentioned before, so as to cancel out the cascading effects of many power rule applications. The polynomials you get by stopping this process at any point are called “Taylor polynomials” for cos(x) around the input x=0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4#t=691.769s
Taylor series | Chapter 11, Essence of calculus	In a case like this, where adding more terms of the series doesn’t approach anything, you say the series diverges. And that maximum distance between the input you’re approximating near, and points where the outputs of these polynomials actually do converge, is called the “radius of convergence” for the Taylor series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4#t=1236.74s
Higher order derivatives | Chapter 10, Essence of calculus	The second derivative, whose notation I’ll explain in a moment, is the derivative of the derivative, meaning it tells you how that slope is changing. The way to see this at a glance is to think of how the graph of f(x) curves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkz5LGWihw#t=53.37s
Higher order derivatives | Chapter 10, Essence of calculus	Or rather, having the car seat push you with a constant force. A negative second derivative indicates slowing down, negative acceleration. The third derivative, and this is not a joke, is called jerk.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkz5LGWihw#t=284.22s
The paradox of the derivative | Chapter 2, Essence of calculus	That way, you can take the change in distance over the change in time. Right? That’s what velocity is, the distance traveled over a given amount of time. So how is it that we’re looking at a function for velocity that only takes in a single value for t, a single snapshot in time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk#t=223.7s
The paradox of the derivative | Chapter 2, Essence of calculus	It’s worth saying a few words on notation here. Throughout this video I’ve been using “dt” to refer to a tiny change in t with some actual size, and “ds” to refer to the resulting tiny change in s, which again has an actual size.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk#t=583.029s
Implicit differentiation, what's going on here? | Chapter 6, Essence of calculus	This is called an “implicit curve”; it’s just the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy some property written in terms of the two variables x and y. The procedure for finding dy/dx here is what I found very weird as a calculus student, you take the derivative of both sides of this equation like this: For the derivative of x2 you write 2x*dx, similarly y2 becomes 2y*dy, and the derivative of the constant 52 on the right is 0. You can see why this feels strange, right? What does it mean to take a derivative of an expression with multiple variables? And why are we tacking on the little dy and dx in this way? But if you just blindly move forward with what you get here, you can rearrange to find an expression for dy/dx, which in this case comes out to -x/y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4#t=113.09s
Implicit differentiation, what's going on here? | Chapter 6, Essence of calculus	By the way, all of this is a little peek into multivariable calculus, where you consider functions with multiple inputs, and how they change as you tweak those inputs. The key, as always, is to have a clear image in your head of what tiny nudges are at play, and how exactly they depend on each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4#t=873.07s
Integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus | Chapter 8, Essence of calculus	So there are actually infinitely many different possible antiderivative functions, all of which look like 4t2 - (⅓)t3 + C for some constant C. But there is one piece of information we haven’t used yet that let’s us zero in on which antiderivative to use: The lower bound on the integral.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0#t=774.64s
Integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus | Chapter 8, Essence of calculus	Then the integral equals this antiderivative evaluated at the top bound, minus its value at the bottom bound. This fact is called the “fundamental theorem of calculus”. Here’s what’s crazy about this fact: The integral, the limiting value for the sum of all these thin rectangles, takes into account every single input on the continuum from the lower bound to the upper bound, that’s why we use the word “integrate”; it brings them together. And yet, to actually compute it using the antiderivative, you look at only two inputs: the top and the bottom. It almost feels like cheating! Finding the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all the information needed to add up all the values between the lower bound and upper bound.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0#t=924.92s
The other way to visualize derivatives | Chapter 12, Essence of calculus	Now, what I want to share with you is a way to think about derivatives which I'll refer to as the transformational view, that generalizes more seamlessly into some of those more general context where calculus comes up And then we'll use this alternate view to analyze a certain fun puzzle about repeated fractions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfW845LNObM#t=78.4s
Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra	Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment, you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis, and a vertical line, called the y-axis. The place where they intersect is called the origin, which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs#t=172.939s
Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra	"When you multiply it by a negative number, like -1.8, then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8. This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of a vector is called ""scaling"", and whenever you catch a number like 2 or 1/3 or -1.8 acting like this—scaling some vector—you call it a ""scalar""."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs#t=437.72s
Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra	Anyway to translate between vectors and sets of numbers is called a coordinate system and the two special vectors, i-hat and j-hat, are called the basis vectors of our standard coordinate system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA#t=78.07s
Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra	Remember, the inverse of a transformation is a new transformation that corresponds to playing that first one backwards. In practice, especially when you're working in more than two dimensions you'd use a computer to compute the matrix that actually represents this inverse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA#t=460.91s
Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra	Start with any vector written in Jennifer's language. Rather than trying to follow what happens to it in terms of her language first, we're going to translate it into our language using the change of basis matrix the one whose columns represent her basis vectors in our language.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA#t=623.76s
Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3, Essence of linear algebra	Isn't that cool? it's common to package these coordinates into a two-by-two grid of numbers, called a two-by-two matrix, where you can interpret the columns as the two special vectors where i-hat and j-hat each land.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE#t=376.75s
Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3, Essence of linear algebra	If the vectors that i-hat and j-hat land on are linearly dependent which, if you recall from last video, means that one is a scaled version of the other. It means that the linear transformation squishes all of 2D space on to the line where those two vectors sit, also known as the one-dimensional span of those two linearly dependent vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE#t=561.88s
Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3, Essence of linear algebra	To sum up, linear transformations are a way to move around space such that the grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced and such that the origin remains fixed. Delightfully, these transformations can be described using only a handful of numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE#t=584.74s
Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra	A transformation is linear if it satisfies two properties, commonly called additivity and scaling. Additivity means that if you add two vectors, v and w, then apply a transformation to their sum, you get the same result as if you added the transformed versions of v and w.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8#t=279.16s
Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra	The scaling property is that when you scale a vector v by some number, then apply the transformation, you get the same ultimate vector as if you scale the transformed version of v by that same amount.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8#t=300.27s
Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra	"These sets of vector-ish things, like arrows or lists of numbers or functions, are called vector spaces, and what you as the mathematician might want to do is say, ""Hey everyone! I don't want to think about all the different types of crazy vector spaces that you all might come up with, so what you do is establish a list of rules that vector addition and scaling have to abide by."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8#t=733.54s
Cramer's rule, explained geometrically | Chapter 12, Essence of linear algebra	They tend to get bigger since most vectors are getting stretched. In fact, transformations which do preserve dot products are special enough to have their own name: Orthonormal transformations. These are the ones which leave all the basis vectors perpendicular to each other with unit lengths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBsC34PxzoM#t=267.14s
A quick trick for computing eigenvalues | Chapter 15, Essence of linear algebra	"As a quick reminder, if the effect of a linear transformation on a given vector is to scale it by some constant, we call it an ""eigenvector"" of the transformation, and we call the relevant scaling factor the corresponding ""eigenvalue,"" often denoted with the letter lambda. When you write this as an equation and you rearrange a little bit, what you see is that if the number lambda is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, then the matrix (A minus lambda times the identity) must send some nonzero vector, namely the corresponding eigenvector, to the zero vector, which in turn means the determinant of this modified matrix must be 0."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50Bj7jn9IQ#t=23.349s
A quick trick for computing eigenvalues | Chapter 15, Essence of linear algebra	Doing this always involves a few steps to expand out and simplify to get a clean quadratic polynomial, what's known as the “characteristic polynomial” of the matrix. The eigenvalues are the roots of this polynomial. So to find them you have to apply the quadratic formula, which itself typically requires one or two more steps of simplification.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50Bj7jn9IQ#t=87.89s
Cross products | Chapter 10, Essence of linear algebra	So what this means for the operation is that 3v̅×w̅ will be exactly three times the value of v̅×w̅ . Now, even though all of this is a perfectly fine mathematical operation what i just described is technically not the cross-product. The true cross product is something that combines two different 3D vectors to get a new 3D vector. Just as before, we're still going to consider the parallelogram defined by the two vectors that were crossing together. And the area of this parallelogram is still going to play a big role. To be concrete let's say that the area is 2.5 for the vectors shown here but as I said the cross product is not a number it's a vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6i7WJeinw#t=289.12s
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra	"As you might have guessed by now, these special vectors are called the ""eigenvectors"" of the transformation, and each eigenvector has associated with it, what's called an ""eigenvalue"", which is just the factor by which it stretched or squashed during the transformation."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g#t=202.61s
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra	Symbolically, here's what the idea of an eigenvector looks like. A is the matrix representing some transformation, with v as the eigenvector, and λ is a number, namely the corresponding eigenvalue. What this expression is saying is that the matrix-vector product - A times v gives the same result as just scaling the eigenvector v by some value λ.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g#t=327.14s
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra	"A set of basis vectors, which are also eigenvectors, is called, again, reasonably enough, an ""eigenbasis"". So if, for example, you needed to compute the 100-th power of this matrix, it would be much easier to change to an eigenbasis, compute the 100-th power in that system, then convert back to our standard system."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g#t=955.77s
Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2, Essence of linear algebra	"When you have a pair of numbers that's meant to describe a vector, like [3, -2], I want you to think about each coordinate as a scalar, meaning, think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors, In the xy-coordinate system, there are two very special vectors: the one pointing to the right with length 1, commonly called ""i-hat"", or the unit vector in the x-direction, and the one pointing straight up, with length 1, commonly called ""j-hat"", or the unit vector in the y-direction."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY#t=32.95s
Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2, Essence of linear algebra	Here's some more terminology: The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination of a given pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY#t=241.38s
Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2, Essence of linear algebra	"The technical definition of a basis of a space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span that space. Now, given how I described a basis earlier, and given your current understanding of the words ""span"" and ""linearly independent"", think about why this definition would make sense."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY#t=552.89s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	Cool, right? To start simple, let's say you have a system with two equations and two unknowns. This means that the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, and v and x are each two dimensional vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=193.14s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	If A was a rightward shear that pushes j-hat one unit to the right, the inverse of a would be a leftward shear that pushes j-hat one unit to the left. In general, A inverse is the unique transformation with the property that if you first apply A, then follow it with the transformation A inverse, you end up back where you started.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=274.78s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"The transformation that does nothing is called the ""identity transformation."" It leaves i-hat and j-hat each where they are, unmoved, so its columns are one, zero, and zero, one. Once you find this inverse, which, in practice, you do with a computer, you can solve your equation by multiplying this inverse matrix by v."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=308.19s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	As long as the transformation A doesn't squish all of space into a lower dimension, meaning, its determinant is nonzero, there will be an inverse transformation, A inverse, with the property that if you first do A, then you do A inverse, it's the same as doing nothing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=376.08s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"If all the vectors land on some two-dimensional plane, We say the transformation has a ""rank"" of two. So the word ""rank"" means the number of dimensions in the output of a transformation."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=495.3s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"This set of all possible outputs for your matrix, whether it's a line, a plane, 3D space, whatever, is called the ""column space"" of your matrix. You can probably guess where that name comes from."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=534.65s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"So, a more precise definition of rank would be that it's the number of dimensions in the column space. When this rank is as high as it can be, meaning it equals the number of columns, we call the matrix ""full rank."" Notice, the zero vector will always be included in the column space, since linear transformations must keep the origin fixed in place."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=562.26s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"If a 3D transformation squishes all the space onto a line, then there's a whole plane full of vectors that land on the origin. This set of vectors that lands on the origin is called the ""null space"" or the ""kernel"" of your matrix."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=620.8s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	It's the space of all vectors that become null, in the sense that they land on the zero vector. In terms of the linear system of equations, when v happens to be the zero vector, the null space gives you all of the possible solutions to the equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=639.37s
Matrix multiplication as composition | Chapter 4, Essence of linear algebra	This is worth a quick recap, because it's just really important. But of course, if this feels like more than just a recap, go back and watch the full video. Technically speaking, linear transformations are functions, with vectors as inputs and vectors as outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU#t=18.369s
Matrix multiplication as composition | Chapter 4, Essence of linear algebra	Based on how things are written down here I think it's reasonable to call this new matrix, the “product” of the original two matrices. Don't you? We can think about how to compute that product more generally in just a moment, but it's way too easy to get lost in the forest of numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU#t=222.31s
How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6	And similarly, if you multiply it by [0, 1]  that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you look at a matrix, you  can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors, known as the basis  vectors. The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding these two  basis results by that vector’s coordinates.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo#t=653.84s
How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6	A much less whimsical example  is Shrödinger’s famous equation, which is the fundamental equation describing  how systems in quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty intimidating, and I  mean, it’s quantum mechanics so of course it will, but it’s actually not that different from the  Romeo-Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a vector that packages  together all the information you might care about in a system, like the various particles’  positions and momenta. It's analogous to our simpler 2d vector that encoded all the information  about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that the rate at which this state vector changes  looks like a certain matrix times itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo#t=826.32s
How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6	This is a highly important equation in its  own right. It's a very powerful concept when the rate of change of a value  is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing  things like compound interest, or the early stages of population growth before  the effects of limited resources kicks in, or the early stages of an epidemic while  most of the population is susceptible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo#t=908.96s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	These equations come in two flavors; Ordinary differential equations, or ODEs, involving functions with a single input, often thought of as time, and Partial differential equations, or PDEs, dealing with functions that have multiple inputs. Partial derivatives are something we’ll look at more closely in the next video; you often think of them involving a whole continuum of values changing with time, like the temperature of every point in a solid body, or the velocity of a fluid at every point in space. Ordinary differential equations, our focus for now, involve only a finite collection of values changing with time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=75.34s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	So often in differential equations, the puzzles you face involve finding a function whose derivative and/or higher order derivatives are defined in terms of itself. In physics, it’s most common to work with second order differential equations, which means the highest derivative you find in the expression here is a second derivative. Higher order differential equations would be ones with third derivatives, fourth derivatives and so on; puzzles with more intricate clues.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=297.12s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	In math, we often call a space like this a “phase space”. You’ll hear me use the term broadly for spaces encoding all kinds of states for changing systems, but you should know that in the context of physics, especially Hamiltonian mechanics, the term is often reserved for a special case. Namely, a space whose axes represent position and momentum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=1099.59s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	It may seem like a simple idea, depending on how well indoctrinated you are to modern ways of thinking about math, but it’s worth keeping in mind that it took humanity quite a while to really embrace thinking of dynamics spatially like this, especially when the dimensions get very large. In his book Chaos, James Gleick describes phase space as “one of the most powerful inventions of modern science.” One reason it’s powerful is that you can ask questions not just about a single initial state, but a whole spectrum of initial states. The collection of all possible trajectories is reminiscent of a moving fluid, so we call it phase flow.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=1147.98s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	So, we'll start with the late 1800s understanding of light as waves in the electromagnetic field. Here, let's break that down a bit. The electric field is a vector field, and that means every point in space has some arrow attached to it, indicating the direction and strength of the field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=99.14s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	For example, a wire with a current of moving charges next to a magnet is either pushed or pulled by that magnetic field. A kind of culmination of the 19th century physics understanding of how these two fields work are Maxwell's equations, which among other things describe how each of these fields can cause a change to the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=150.89s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	But all you need to know for now is that one natural consequence of this mutual interplay and how changes to one field cause changes to the other in its neighboring regions is that you get these propagating waves, where the electric field and magnetic fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other, and perpendicular to the direction of propagation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=196.18s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	"And also, we're only going to focus on one of these vectors oscillating in the plane of the screen, which we'll think of as the xy plane. If it oscillates horizontally like this, we say that the light is ""horizontally polarized"", so the y component of this electric field is zero at all times."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=276.09s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	"Now, the choice of which directions you write things in terms of is called a ""basis"". And which basis is nicest to work with? Well, that typically depends on what you're actually doing with the light."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=526.29s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	This is a really surprising fluid flow phenomenon, where a donut-shaped region of fluid stays surprisingly stable as it moves through space. If you take some open container with a lip, and you fill it with smoke (or fog), you can use this to actually see the otherwise-invisible ring.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=48.7s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	This term stems from the same Latin word that 'lamination' does: 'lamina', meaning 'a thin layer of a material', and it refers to smooth flow in a fluid, where the moving particles stay largely confined to distinct layers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=215.3s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	Patterns like whirlpools, or even smoke rings, have high vorticity (since the fluid is rotating), but can nevertheless be smooth and predictable. Instead, turbulence further characterized as being chaotic, meaning small changes to the initial conditions result in large changes to the ensuing patterns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=245.4s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	"""Reasonable"" here means things like not blowing to a point of having infinite kinetic energy, and that smooth initial states yield smooth solutions, where the word 'smooth' carries with it a very precise meaning in this context."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=354.1s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	Turbulence, on the other hand, is characterized by kinetic energy at a whole spectrum of length scales, from the movement of large eddies, to smaller ones, and smaller ones, and smaller ones still.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=441.5s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	So keep in mind, while you're looking at this 2-D slice of turbulence, it's actually very different in character from turbulence in 2-D. One of the mechanisms behind this energy cascade (which could only ever happen in 3 dimensions) is a process known as 'vortex stretching': a rotating part of the fluid will tend to stretch out, perpendicular to the plane of rotation, resulting in smaller eddies, spinning faster.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=577.4s
Feynman's Lost Lecture (ft. 3Blue1Brown)	Here, I’d like to give a more animated and slightly simplified retelling of the argument Feynman presented. The lecture itself is about why planets and other astronomical objects orbit the sun in ellipses. It ultimately has to do with the inverse square law, the fact that the gravitational force pulling an object towards the sun is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the orbiting object and the sun. But why? How exactly does that give rise to an ellipse, of all shapes? Of course, the gravitational attraction between planets, moons comets and such means that no one orbit is a perfect ellipse, but to a very good approximation this is the shape of an orbit. You can solve this analytically, setting up the appropriate differential equation and seeing the formula for an ellipse pop out, but Feynman’s goal was not to rely on any heavy mathematical machinery. In fact, let’s take a listen to him articulate his own goal. I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration. But elementary does not mean easy to understand. Elementary means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence. There may be a large number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU#t=147.83s
Feynman's Lost Lecture (ft. 3Blue1Brown)	It’s similar to how you might use a single pushpin to construct a circle, where the fixed length of string guarantees that every point you trace is a constant distance from the thumbtack. But in this case, with two thumbtacks, what property are you guaranteeing about each point you trace? Well, at every point, the sum of the distances from that point to each of the thumbtacks will be the full length of the string, right? So the defining property of this curve is that when you draw lines from any point on the curve to these two special thumbtack locations, the sum of the lengths of those lines is a constant, namely the length of the string. Each of these points is called a “focus” of your ellipse, collectively called “foci”. Fun fact, the word focus comes from the latin for “fireplace”, since one of the first places ellipses were studied was for orbits around the sun, a sort of fireplace of the solar system, sitting at one of the foci of a planet’s orbit. Making up a bit of terminology, let’s call this constant sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci the “focal sum” of the ellipse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU#t=268.91s
Feynman's Lost Lecture (ft. 3Blue1Brown)	The reason this will be important, as you’ll say later, is that this tangency direction will correspond to the velocity of an orbiting object. Okay, geometry proofiness done, onto some actual physics and orbital mechanics! The first fact to use is Kepler’s (very beautiful) second law, which says that as an object orbits around the sun, the area it sweeps out during a given amount of time, like 1 day, will be a constant, no matter where you are in the orbit.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU#t=533.33s
Binary, Hanoi, and Sierpinski, part 2	What I'm going to do is represent each one of these configurations with a dot, a node in our graph. Then, we say that two different configurations are connected if you could move from one to the other with some legal Towers of Hanoi move.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdMfjfT0lKk#t=467.5s
How to send a self-correcting message (Hamming codes)	In the jargon, whether a group of bits has an even or odd number of 1’s is known as its “parity”. You could also use numbers and say that the parity is 0 or 1, which is typically more helpful once you start doing math with the idea.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA#t=418.67s
How to send a self-correcting message (Hamming codes)	And this special bit that the sender uses to control the parity is called a “parity bit”. And actually, we should be clear, if the receiver sees an odd parity, it doesn't necessarily mean there was just 1 error.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA#t=431.29s
The unexpectedly hard windmill question (2011 IMO, Q2)	So you can probably predict that the problem involves drawing lines here in a way where three points on one line would mess things up. “A windmill is a process that starts with a line l going through a single point P in S. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot P until the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to S”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM#t=104.02s
Triangle of Power	The natural question that a student might ask from here is if there's an analogous rule for when the lower right stays constant. There is! You have to introduce a new operation, which for the sake of this video I'll call o-plus, where a o-plus b equals 1 / (1/a + 1/b) This is not actually a ridiculous thing to introduce, since it comes up in physics all the time like when you're computing parallel resistance.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck#t=306.1s
The essence of calculus	And we care about derivatives because they help us solve problems, and in our little exploration here, we already have a slight glimpse of one way that they're used. They are the key to solving integral questions, problems that require finding the area under a curve.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM#t=889.04s
The essence of calculus	"Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives, you'll be able to look at a situation like this one where you don't know what a function is but you do know that its derivative should be x squared and from that reverse engineer what the function must be. And this back and forth between integrals and derivatives where the derivative of a function for the area under a graph gives you back the function defining the graph itself is called the ""Fundamental theorem of calculus"". It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives, and it shows how, in some sense, each one is an inverse of the other."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM#t=904.32s
Hamming codes part 2, the elegance of it all	I’m assuming that everybody here is coming in from part 1. We were talking about Hamming codes, a way to create a block of data where most of the bits carry a meaningful message, while a few others act as a kind of redundancy in such a way that if any bit gets flipped, either a message bit or a redundancy bit, anything in this block, a receiver is going to be able to identify that there was an error and how to fix it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3NxrZOu_CE#t=0.06s
Hamming codes part 2, the elegance of it all	It’s based on the xor function. Xor, for those of you who don’t know, stands for “exclusive or”; when you take the xor of two bits, it's going to return a 1 if either one of those bits is turned on, but not if both are turned on or if both are turned off.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3NxrZOu_CE#t=283.46s
Why π is in the normal distribution (beyond integral tricks)	"Mathematically, this means that the function  describing your probability distribution, which I'll call ""f2"" since it takes in two  inputs, X and Y. Well, it can be expressed as some single variable function of the radius,  r. And just to spell it out, r is the distance between the point xy and the origin, the  square root of X squared plus Y squared."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy8r7WSuT1I#t=850.44s
Beyond the Mandelbrot set, an intro to holomorphic dynamics	"So, first of all, this word ""holomorphic"" might  seem a little weird. It refers to functions that have complex number inputs and complex number  outputs and which you can also take a derivative of. Basically what it means to have a derivative  in this context is that when you zoom in to how the function behaves near a given point, to  the point and its neighbors, it looks roughly like scaling and rotating, like multiplying by  some complex constant. We'll talk more about that in just a bit, but for now know that it  includes most of the ordinary functions that you could write down, things like polynomials,  exponentials, trig functions, all of that."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbZpur38nw#t=34.72s
Beyond the Mandelbrot set, an intro to holomorphic dynamics	Incidentally this means that you  could also find those fixed points using Newton's method, but maybe that's  a little bit too meta for us right now. Just asking about fixed points is maybe  easy, but a key idea for understanding the full dynamics, and hence the  diagrams that we're looking at, is to understand stability. We say  that a fixed point is attracting if nearby points tend to get drawn in towards  it, and repelling if they're pushed away. And this is something that you can actually compute  explicitly using the derivative of the function.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbZpur38nw#t=581.12s
Beyond the Mandelbrot set, an intro to holomorphic dynamics	If a point eventually falls into  some stable predictable pattern, we say that it's part of the Fatou set  of our iterated function. And for all the maps that we've seen, this includes almost  everything. The julia set is everything else, which in the pictures we've seen would be the  rough boundaries between the colored regions, what happens as you transition from one stable  attractor to another. For example, the julia set will include all of the repelling cycles and the  repelling fixed points. A typical point from the julia set, though, will not be a cycle, it'll  bounce around forever with no clear pattern.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbZpur38nw#t=1356.32s
Simulating an epidemic	These simulations represent what’s called an “SIR model”, meaning the population is broken up into three categories, those who are susceptible to the given disease, those who are infectious, and those who have recovered from the infection.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs#t=72.63s
Simulating an epidemic	It also means that the most dangerous viruses are the ones that kill some part of the population, while laying unnoticed and spreadable among others. Or worse yet, if they remain unnoticed and spreadable in everyone before becoming lethal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs#t=582.55s
Simulating an epidemic	The average for this count across everyone who has been sick is known as the effective reproductive number, or R. A more commonly discussed number is R_0, which is the value of R in a fully susceptible population, like at the very beginning.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs#t=886.16s
Simulating an epidemic	While R is greater than 1, the infection is growing exponentially, and is known as an epidemic. If it holds steady around 1, it’s called “endemic”. And less than 1 means it’s on the decline.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs#t=962.139s
Simulating an epidemic	And our little dots don’t even have to be repelled by each other or stop their trips to the market. In real epidemiology it gets more sophisticated than this, with tactics like “contact tracing” where you not only identify and isolate known cases, but you do the same for everyone who’s been in contact with those cases.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs#t=1219.47s
Simulating an epidemic	I’m writing this during a pandemic, when some viewers may be able to identify all too well with the trembling dots retreating to the edge of their box. But in the future many people will be watching it during a pandemic that never was; a time when a novel pathogen that would spread widely if left unchecked is instead swiftly found and contained.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs#t=1301.539s
Taylor series | Chapter 11, Essence of calculus	To do that, make each coefficient of this polynomial follow this same pattern, but divide each one by the appropriate factorial, like I mentioned before, so as to cancel out the cascading effects of many power rule applications. The polynomials you get by stopping this process at any point are called “Taylor polynomials” for cos(x) around the input x=0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4#t=691.769s
Taylor series | Chapter 11, Essence of calculus	In a case like this, where adding more terms of the series doesn’t approach anything, you say the series diverges. And that maximum distance between the input you’re approximating near, and points where the outputs of these polynomials actually do converge, is called the “radius of convergence” for the Taylor series.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4#t=1236.74s
Pi hiding in prime regularities	It’s a lot, but good math takes time, and we’ll take it step by step. When I say “lattice point”, I mean a point (a, b) in the plane where a and b are both integers, a point where grid lines cross. If you draw a circle centered at the origin, say with radius 10, how many lattice points would you guess are inside that circle? Well, there’s one lattice point for each unit of area, so the answer should be approximately equal to the area of the circle, pi*R2, which in this case is pi(102). And for a really big radius, like 1,000,000, you’d expect this to be more accurate, in the sense that the percent error between the estimate pi*R2 and the actual count of lattice points should get smaller. If you can find a second way to answer the same question, how many lattice points are in this circle, it might lead you to another way to express the area of a circle, and hence another way to express pi.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY#t=149.98s
Higher order derivatives | Chapter 10, Essence of calculus	The second derivative, whose notation I’ll explain in a moment, is the derivative of the derivative, meaning it tells you how that slope is changing. The way to see this at a glance is to think of how the graph of f(x) curves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkz5LGWihw#t=53.37s
Higher order derivatives | Chapter 10, Essence of calculus	Or rather, having the car seat push you with a constant force. A negative second derivative indicates slowing down, negative acceleration.

Solving Wordle using information theory	"Again ignoring its recommendation, because  we can't let machines rule our lives... And I suppose I should mention another  thing different here is over on the left, that uncertainty value, that number of bits, is no  longer just redundant with the number of possible matches. Now if we pull it up, and you know,  we calculated, say, 2 to the 8.02, which would be a little above 256...I guess 259. What it's  saying is even though there are 526 total words that actually match this pattern, the amount of  uncertainty it has is more akin to what it would be if there were 259 equally likely outcomes. You  could think of it like this, it knows ""borks"" is not the answer same with ""yortz"" and ""zoril"" and  ""zorus"". So it's a little less uncertain than it was in the previous case, this number of bits will  be smaller. And if I keep playing the game, I'll refining this down with a couple guesses that are  apropos of what I would like to explain here..."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA#t=1435.68s
Using topology to solve a counting riddle | The Borsuk-Ulam theorem and stolen necklaces	As you do this, many different pairs of points will land on top of each other once it hits the plane, and that’s no big deal. The special fact that we’ll use, known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, is that you will always be able to find a pair of points that started off on exact opposite sides of the sphere, which land on each other during the mapping. Points on the exact opposite side of a sphere are called “antipodes”, or “antipodal points”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c#t=214.311s
Using topology to solve a counting riddle | The Borsuk-Ulam theorem and stolen necklaces	What I mean by hypersphere is the set of all possible lists of 4-coordinates where the sum of their squares equals 1; those are points in 4d space a distance 1 from the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c#t=1082.8s
Euler's Formula and Graph Duality	A “cycle” is simply a path that ends on the same vertex where it begins. You might be able to guess how cycles will be important for our purposes, since each they always enclose a set of faces.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9OUyo8NFZg#t=109.31s
Euler's Formula and Graph Duality	This frugality will leave him with a set of edges without any cycles, since the edge finishing off a cycle would always be unnecessary. In general a connected graph without cycles is called a tree, so named because we can move things around to make it look like a system of branches, and any tree inside a graph which touches all vertices is called a “spanning tree”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9OUyo8NFZg#t=131.64s
What does it feel like to invent math?	That is to say, organizing them on a line might not be the only reasonable way to organize them. The notion of distance is essentially a function that takes in two numbers and outputs a number indicating how far apart they are.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFDM1ip5HdU#t=545.04s
Alice, Bob, and the average area of a cube's shadow	I think there's an important way that  popularizations of math differ from the feeling of actually doing math. There's this bias  towards showing the slick proofs, the arguments with some clever key insight that lets you avoid  doing calculations. I could just be projecting, since I'm very guilty of this, but what I can tell  you sitting on the other side of the screen here is that it feels a lot more attractive to make a  video about Alice's approach than Bob's. For one, thing in Alice's approach the line of reasoning  is fun. It has these nice aha moments.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltLUadnCyi0#t=2068.4s
Binary, Hanoi and Sierpinski, part 1	In binary, also known as base-2, you limit yourself to two digits, 0 and 1, commonly called 'bits', which is short for binary digits. The result is that when you're counting, you have to roll over all the time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUvWfNJSsM#t=229.83s
The paradox of the derivative | Chapter 2, Essence of calculus	That way, you can take the change in distance over the change in time. Right? That’s what velocity is, the distance traveled over a given amount of time. So how is it that we’re looking at a function for velocity that only takes in a single value for t, a single snapshot in time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk#t=223.7s
The paradox of the derivative | Chapter 2, Essence of calculus	It’s worth saying a few words on notation here. Throughout this video I’ve been using “dt” to refer to a tiny change in t with some actual size, and “ds” to refer to the resulting tiny change in s, which again has an actual size.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk#t=583.029s
Why is pi here?  And why is it squared?  A geometric answer to the Basel problem	That first lighthouse has some Apparent brightness from your point of view, some amount of energy that your eye is receiving from the light per unit time. And let's just call that a brightness of one.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls#t=123.12s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	So, we'll start with the late 1800s understanding of light as waves in the electromagnetic field. Here, let's break that down a bit. The electric field is a vector field, and that means every point in space has some arrow attached to it, indicating the direction and strength of the field.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=99.14s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	For example, a wire with a current of moving charges next to a magnet is either pushed or pulled by that magnetic field. A kind of culmination of the 19th century physics understanding of how these two fields work are Maxwell's equations, which among other things describe how each of these fields can cause a change to the other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=150.89s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	But all you need to know for now is that one natural consequence of this mutual interplay and how changes to one field cause changes to the other in its neighboring regions is that you get these propagating waves, where the electric field and magnetic fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other, and perpendicular to the direction of propagation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=196.18s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	"And also, we're only going to focus on one of these vectors oscillating in the plane of the screen, which we'll think of as the xy plane. If it oscillates horizontally like this, we say that the light is ""horizontally polarized"", so the y component of this electric field is zero at all times."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=276.09s
Some light quantum mechanics (with minutephysics)	"Now, the choice of which directions you write things in terms of is called a ""basis"". And which basis is nicest to work with? Well, that typically depends on what you're actually doing with the light."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4#t=526.29s
Hilbert's Curve: Is infinite math useful?	To be clear: we're not talking about a finite, bounded grid of pixels, like we had in the sound-to-sight application. This is continuous space, which is very infinite and the goal is to have a line which is as thin as thin can be and has zero area somehow pass through every single one of those infinitely many points that makes up the infinite area of space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc#t=475.78s
Hilbert's Curve: Is infinite math useful?	"For this reason we say that the function is ""discontinuous at A"" if there's any lower bound on the size of this circle that surrounds B. If, on the other hand, the circle around B can be made as small as you want with sufficiently small choices for circles around A, you say that the function is ""continuous at A."" The function as a whole is called ""continuous"" if it's continuous at every possible input point."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc#t=727.38s
Hilbert's Curve: Is infinite math useful?	Take a moment to let that fact sink in. A line, the platonic form of thinness itself, can wander through an infinitely-extending and richly dense space and hit every single point. Notice the core property that made Pseudo-Hilbert curves useful in both the sound-to-sight application and in their infinite origins, is that points on the curve move around less and less as you increase the order of those curves.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc#t=925.1s
Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra	Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment, you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis, and a vertical line, called the y-axis. The place where they intersect is called the origin, which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs#t=172.939s
Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra	"When you multiply it by a negative number, like -1.8, then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8. This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of a vector is called ""scaling"", and whenever you catch a number like 2 or 1/3 or -1.8 acting like this—scaling some vector—you call it a ""scalar""."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs#t=437.72s
Why slicing a cone gives an ellipse	Another is the classic two-thumbtacks-and-a-piece-of-string construction. Loop a string around two thumbtacks in a piece of paper, pull it taut with a pencil, then trace around, keeping the string taut the whole time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs#t=69.069s
Why slicing a cone gives an ellipse	The curve of points where the plane and cone intersection forms an ellipse, which is why you’ll hear ellipses described as a “conic section”. Of course, an ellipse is not just one curve, it’s a family of curves, ranging from a perfect circle to something infinitely stretched.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs#t=110.42s
Why slicing a cone gives an ellipse	The specific shape of an ellipse is typically quantified in a number called its “eccentricity”, which I sometimes read in my head as “squishification”. A circle has eccentricity 0, and something more squished has an eccentricity closer to 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs#t=127.479s
But what is the Fourier Transform?  A visual introduction.	Now the output of this function is a complex number, some point in the 2D plane, that corresponds to the strength of a given frequency in the original signal. The plot that I've been graphing for the Fourier transform, is just the real component of that output, the x-coordinate But you could also graph the imaginary component separately, if you wanted a fuller description.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY#t=1055.76s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	This is a really surprising fluid flow phenomenon, where a donut-shaped region of fluid stays surprisingly stable as it moves through space. If you take some open container with a lip, and you fill it with smoke (or fog), you can use this to actually see the otherwise-invisible ring.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=48.7s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	This term stems from the same Latin word that 'lamination' does: 'lamina', meaning 'a thin layer of a material', and it refers to smooth flow in a fluid, where the moving particles stay largely confined to distinct layers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=215.3s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	Patterns like whirlpools, or even smoke rings, have high vorticity (since the fluid is rotating), but can nevertheless be smooth and predictable. Instead, turbulence further characterized as being chaotic, meaning small changes to the initial conditions result in large changes to the ensuing patterns.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=245.4s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	"""Reasonable"" here means things like not blowing to a point of having infinite kinetic energy, and that smooth initial states yield smooth solutions, where the word 'smooth' carries with it a very precise meaning in this context."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=354.1s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	Turbulence, on the other hand, is characterized by kinetic energy at a whole spectrum of length scales, from the movement of large eddies, to smaller ones, and smaller ones, and smaller ones still.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=441.5s
Why 5/3 is a fundamental constant for turbulence	So keep in mind, while you're looking at this 2-D slice of turbulence, it's actually very different in character from turbulence in 2-D. One of the mechanisms behind this energy cascade (which could only ever happen in 3 dimensions) is a process known as 'vortex stretching': a rotating part of the fluid will tend to stretch out, perpendicular to the plane of rotation, resulting in smaller eddies, spinning faster.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE#t=577.4s
We ran a contest for math explainers, here are the results (SoME2)	In the last month or two, there's been a measurable increase in the attention to a wide variety of smaller math channels on YouTube. My friend James and I ran a second iteration of a contest that we did last year, the Summer of Math Exposition which invites people to put up lessons about math online.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDofhN-RJqg#t=0.29s
We ran a contest for math explainers, here are the results (SoME2)	And the last flavour of motivation I'll mention is if you can somehow make the learner feel like they're playing an active role in the lesson. This is very hard to do with a video, may be even impossible, and it's best suited for in-person lessons but one written entry that I thought did this especially well was an inverse turing test, where you as the reader are challenged to come up with a sequence of ones and zeros that appears random and the article goes on to explain various statistical tests that you could apply to prove that the sequence was actually human generated and not really random.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDofhN-RJqg#t=373.46s
We ran a contest for math explainers, here are the results (SoME2)	If you can, motivate using clear examples, not sweeping statements or promises of what is to come. By micro scale motivation, what I mean is whether each new idea that's introduced in the lesson itself feels to the learner like it has a good reason to be there.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDofhN-RJqg#t=483.92s
The Brachistochrone, with Steven Strogatz	You want to say a few words about Mark Levi? Yeah, well Mark Levi is a very clever, as well as a very nice guy who is a friend of mine and terrific mathematician at Penn State, who has written a book called the Mathematical Mecanic, in which he uses principles of mecanics, and more generally physics to solve all kinds of math problems.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU#t=589.18s
The impossible chessboard puzzle	You walk alone into a room to find a chessboard. Each of the 64 squares has a coin sitting on top of it. Backing up, this is going to be one of those classic prisoner puzzles, where a strangely math-obsessed warden offers you and a fellow inmate a chance for freedom, but only if you can solve some elaborate scheme they’ve laid out.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJI_WuZSwE#t=4.06s
The impossible chessboard puzzle	The idea is that when computers send and store data, the messiness of the real world inevitably flips a bit now and then, which completely changes how that data is read, so error correcting codes are a way to add a shockingly small amount of added information to a message that makes it possible for a receiver to identify that there was an error, and more impressively how to fix it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJI_WuZSwE#t=136.54s
Euler's Formula Poem	Numbers act as abstract functions which slide the rich 2d space in its space with a grace when they sum. Multiplied, they don't slide, acting a second way They rotate, and dilate, but keep straight that same plane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLzLxVeqdQg#t=23.72s
Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra	Anyway to translate between vectors and sets of numbers is called a coordinate system and the two special vectors, i-hat and j-hat, are called the basis vectors of our standard coordinate system.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA#t=78.07s
Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra	Remember, the inverse of a transformation is a new transformation that corresponds to playing that first one backwards. In practice, especially when you're working in more than two dimensions you'd use a computer to compute the matrix that actually represents this inverse.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA#t=460.91s
Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra	Start with any vector written in Jennifer's language. Rather than trying to follow what happens to it in terms of her language first, we're going to translate it into our language using the change of basis matrix the one whose columns represent her basis vectors in our language.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA#t=623.76s
Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3, Essence of linear algebra	Isn't that cool? it's common to package these coordinates into a two-by-two grid of numbers, called a two-by-two matrix, where you can interpret the columns as the two special vectors where i-hat and j-hat each land.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE#t=376.75s
Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3, Essence of linear algebra	If the vectors that i-hat and j-hat land on are linearly dependent which, if you recall from last video, means that one is a scaled version of the other. It means that the linear transformation squishes all of 2D space on to the line where those two vectors sit, also known as the one-dimensional span of those two linearly dependent vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE#t=561.88s
Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3, Essence of linear algebra	To sum up, linear transformations are a way to move around space such that the grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced and such that the origin remains fixed. Delightfully, these transformations can be described using only a handful of numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE#t=584.74s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	A collection of all of the actions like this taken together is called a “group”. kind of... at least... groups are typically defined more abstractly than this, but we’ll get to that later.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=80.95s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	You know how in order to find the two roots of a quadratic equation, everyone learns a certain formula in school? Slightly lesser known is the fact that there’s also a cubic formula, one that involves nesting cube roots with square roots in a larger expression.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=304.53s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	When you have a correspondence where this remains true for all products, it’s called an “isomorphism”, which is maybe the most important idea in group theory. This particular isomorphism between cube rotations and permutations of four objects is a bit subtle, but for the curious among you, you may enjoy taking a moment to think hard about how the rotations of a cube permute its four diagonals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=738.54s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	In fact, seeing the same group come out of different situations is a great way to reveal unexpected connections between distinct objects; that’s a very common theme in modern math. And once you understand this about groups, it leads you to a natural question, which will eventually lead us to the monster: What are all the groups? But now you’re in a position to ask that question in a more sophisticated way: What are all the groups up to isomorphism, which is to say we consider two groups to be the same if there’s an isomorphism between them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=797.329s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	The ones which can’t be broken down any further, analogous to prime numbers or atoms, are known as the “simple groups”. To give a hint for why this is useful, remember how we said that group theory can be used to prove that there’s no formula for a degree-5 polynomial the way there is for quadratic equations? Well, if you're wondering what that proof actually looks like, it involves showing that if there were some kind of mythical quintic formula, something which uses only radicals and the basic arithmetic operations, it would imply that the permutation group on 5 elements decomposes into a special kind of simple group, known fancifully as cyclic groups of prime order.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=878.139s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	The largest of these sporadic groups is known, thanks to John Conway, as the monster group, and its size is the number I mentioned at the start. The second largest, and I promise this isn’t a joke, is known as the baby monster group. [monster: don't talk to me or my son ever again] Together with the baby monster 19 of the sporadic groups are in a certain sense children of the monster, and Robert Griess called these 20 the “happy family”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=1078.77s
Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster	Now, at this point, that I introduced groups as symmetries, a collection of actions, you might wonder what it is that the monster acts on. What object does it describe the symmetries of? Well, there is an answer, but it doesn’t fit into 2 or 3 dimensions to draw.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE#t=1128.42s
Implicit differentiation, what's going on here? | Chapter 6, Essence of calculus	This is called an “implicit curve”; it’s just the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy some property written in terms of the two variables x and y. The procedure for finding dy/dx here is what I found very weird as a calculus student, you take the derivative of both sides of this equation like this: For the derivative of x2 you write 2x*dx, similarly y2 becomes 2y*dy, and the derivative of the constant 52 on the right is 0. You can see why this feels strange, right? What does it mean to take a derivative of an expression with multiple variables? And why are we tacking on the little dy and dx in this way? But if you just blindly move forward with what you get here, you can rearrange to find an expression for dy/dx, which in this case comes out to -x/y.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4#t=113.09s
Implicit differentiation, what's going on here? | Chapter 6, Essence of calculus	By the way, all of this is a little peek into multivariable calculus, where you consider functions with multiple inputs, and how they change as you tweak those inputs. The key, as always, is to have a clear image in your head of what tiny nudges are at play, and how exactly they depend on each other.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4#t=873.07s
The medical test paradox, and redesigning Bayes' rule	"In medical parlance you would call this the  ""Positive Predictive Value"" of the test, or PPV. The number of true positives divided by  the total number of positive test results. You can see where the name comes from to  what extent does a positive test result actually predict that you have the disease."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko#t=128.88s
The medical test paradox, and redesigning Bayes' rule	Test accuracy is not actually one number but  two. First you ask how often is the test correct on those with the disease, this is known as  the test sensitivity. As in how sensitive is it to detecting the presence of the disease. In  our example test sensitivity is 9 in 10 or 90%.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko#t=163.76s
The medical test paradox, and redesigning Bayes' rule	Another way to say the same fact would  be to say the false negative rate is 10%. And then a separate not-necessarily-related  number is how often it's correct for those without the disease, which is known as the  test specificity. As in, are positive results caused specifically by the disease or are there  confounding triggers giving false positives? In our example the specificity is about 91%. Or  another way to say the same fact would be to say the false positive rate is 9%. So the paradox  here is that in one sense the test is over 90% accurate, it gives correct results to  over 90% of the patients who take it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko#t=182.16s
The medical test paradox, and redesigning Bayes' rule	"We might call this a ""vertical paradox"", which  refers to facts that are provably true but which nevertheless can feel false when phrased a certain  way. It's sort of the softest form of a paradox, saying more about human psychology than about  logic. The question is how we can combat this."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko#t=335.28s
The medical test paradox, and redesigning Bayes' rule	And by the way this whole time we've been using  the prevalence of the disease, which is the proportion of people in a population who have it,  as a substitute for the prior, the probability of having it before you see a test. However that's  not necessarily the case! If there are other known factors, things like symptoms, or in the case of  a contagious disease things like known contacts, those also factor into the prior, and they  could potentially make a huge difference.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko#t=916.0s
Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra	A transformation is linear if it satisfies two properties, commonly called additivity and scaling. Additivity means that if you add two vectors, v and w, then apply a transformation to their sum, you get the same result as if you added the transformed versions of v and w.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8#t=279.16s
Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra	The scaling property is that when you scale a vector v by some number, then apply the transformation, you get the same ultimate vector as if you scale the transformed version of v by that same amount.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8#t=300.27s
Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra	"These sets of vector-ish things, like arrows or lists of numbers or functions, are called vector spaces, and what you as the mathematician might want to do is say, ""Hey everyone! I don't want to think about all the different types of crazy vector spaces that you all might come up with, so what you do is establish a list of rules that vector addition and scaling have to abide by."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8#t=733.54s
How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6	And similarly, if you multiply it by [0, 1]  that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you look at a matrix, you  can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors, known as the basis  vectors. The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding these two  basis results by that vector’s coordinates.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo#t=653.84s
How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6	A much less whimsical example  is Shrödinger’s famous equation, which is the fundamental equation describing  how systems in quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty intimidating, and I  mean, it’s quantum mechanics so of course it will, but it’s actually not that different from the  Romeo-Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a vector that packages  together all the information you might care about in a system, like the various particles’  positions and momenta. It's analogous to our simpler 2d vector that encoded all the information  about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that the rate at which this state vector changes  looks like a certain matrix times itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo#t=826.32s
How (and why) to raise e to the power of a matrix | DE6	This is a highly important equation in its  own right. It's a very powerful concept when the rate of change of a value  is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing  things like compound interest, or the early stages of population growth before  the effects of limited resources kicks in, or the early stages of an epidemic while  most of the population is susceptible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo#t=908.96s
Cramer's rule, explained geometrically | Chapter 12, Essence of linear algebra	They tend to get bigger since most vectors are getting stretched. In fact, transformations which do preserve dot products are special enough to have their own name: Orthonormal transformations. These are the ones which leave all the basis vectors perpendicular to each other with unit lengths.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBsC34PxzoM#t=267.14s
Olympiad level counting	And if you go in and you look at the details of  how what we now call “Shor's algorithm” works, the idea is essentially this, the use of roots of  unity to detect a kind of frequency information.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXCLR3Wric#t=2018.4s
But what is the Central Limit Theorem?	Usually, if you think of rolling a die, you think  of the six outcomes as being equally probable, but the theorem actually doesn't care about that. We  could start with a weighted die - something with a non-trivial distribution across the outcomes and  the core idea still holds, for the simulation what will do is take some distribution, like this one  that is skewed towards lower values. I'm going to take 10 distinct samples from that distribution,  and then I'll record the sum of that sample on the plot, on the bottom. Then I'm going to do  this many many different times. Always with the sum of size 10 but keep track of where those sums  ended up to give us a sense of the distribution.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo#t=380.88s
But what is the Central Limit Theorem?	The mean of a distribution, often  denoted with a Greek letter, mu, is a way of capturing the center of mass for that  distribution. It's calculated as the expected. Value of our random variable, which is a  way of saying you go through all of the different possible outcomes and you multiply  the probability of that outcome times the value of the variable. If higher values are more  probable, that weighted sum is going to be bigger, if lower values are more probable, that  weighted time is going to be smaller.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo#t=703.68s
But what is the Central Limit Theorem?	Then the actual rigorous no jokes this time  statement of the central limit theorem is that if you consider the probability that this value  falls between two given real numbers, a and b, and you consider the limit of that probability  as the size of your sum goes to infinity, then that limit is equal to a certain  integral, which basically describes the area under a standard normal  distribution between those two values.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo#t=1465.5s
Integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus | Chapter 8, Essence of calculus	So there are actually infinitely many different possible antiderivative functions, all of which look like 4t2 - (⅓)t3 + C for some constant C. But there is one piece of information we haven’t used yet that let’s us zero in on which antiderivative to use: The lower bound on the integral.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0#t=774.64s
Integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus | Chapter 8, Essence of calculus	Then the integral equals this antiderivative evaluated at the top bound, minus its value at the bottom bound. This fact is called the “fundamental theorem of calculus”. Here’s what’s crazy about this fact: The integral, the limiting value for the sum of all these thin rectangles, takes into account every single input on the continuum from the lower bound to the upper bound, that’s why we use the word “integrate”; it brings them together. And yet, to actually compute it using the antiderivative, you look at only two inputs: the top and the bottom. It almost feels like cheating! Finding the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all the information needed to add up all the values between the lower bound and upper bound.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0#t=924.92s
Why do colliding blocks compute pi?	What we’ve drawn here is called a “phase diagram”, which is a simple but powerful idea in math where you encode the state of some system, in this case the velocities of our sliding blocks, as a single point in some abstract space. What’s powerful here is that it turns questions about dynamics into questions about geometry. In this case, the dynamical idea of all pairs of velocities that conserve energy corresponds to the geometric object of a circle, and counting the total number of collisions turns into counting the number of hops along these lines, alternating between vertical and diagonal.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE#t=367.99s
Why do colliding blocks compute pi?	The key here is to use the ever-helpful inscribed angle theorem, which says that whenever you form an angle using three points on a circle P1, P2 and P3 like this, it will be exactly half the angle formed by P1, the circle’s center, and P3. P2 can be anywhere on this circle, except in that arc between P1 and P3, and this fact will be true.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE#t=436.36s
Winding numbers and domain coloring	Here, we’ve used different “hues” (that is, where the color falls along a rainbow or color wheel) to correspond to the direction away from the origin, while we’ve used darkness or brightness to correspond to distance from the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FxPsqfkOY#t=286.939s
Winding numbers and domain coloring	A tight loop here will be all blue-ish; a tight loop here will be all yellow-ish, etc. You certainly won’t get every color of the rainbow. The only point you can tighten loops around while still going through all the colors of the rainbow is the colorless origin: zero itself.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FxPsqfkOY#t=589.86s
But how does bitcoin actually work?	Hand-in-hand with this is a function to verify that a signature is valid, and this is where the public key comes into play. All it does it output true or false to indicate if this was a signature created by the private key associated with the public key you use for the verification.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4#t=321.309s
But how does bitcoin actually work?	To emphasize this point, let’s start referring to quantities on the ledger as “LedgerDollars”, or LD for short. You’re of course free to exchange LedgerDollars for real US dollars, for example maybe Alice gives Bob a $10 bill in the real world in exchange for him adding and signing the transaction “Bob pays Alice 10 LedgerDollars” to the communal ledger.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4#t=546.41s
But how does bitcoin actually work?	A hash function takes in any kind of message or file, and outputs a string of bits with a fixed length, like 256 bits. This output is called the “hash” or “digest” of the message, and it’s meant to look random.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4#t=747.45s
But how does bitcoin actually work?	It also means that the total number of LedgerDollars in our economy increases with each new block. Creating blocks is often called “mining”, since it requires a lot of work, and it introduces new bits of currency into the economy.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4#t=1093.3s
A quick trick for computing eigenvalues | Chapter 15, Essence of linear algebra	"As a quick reminder, if the effect of a linear transformation on a given vector is to scale it by some constant, we call it an ""eigenvector"" of the transformation, and we call the relevant scaling factor the corresponding ""eigenvalue,"" often denoted with the letter lambda. When you write this as an equation and you rearrange a little bit, what you see is that if the number lambda is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, then the matrix (A minus lambda times the identity) must send some nonzero vector, namely the corresponding eigenvector, to the zero vector, which in turn means the determinant of this modified matrix must be 0."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50Bj7jn9IQ#t=23.349s
A quick trick for computing eigenvalues | Chapter 15, Essence of linear algebra	Doing this always involves a few steps to expand out and simplify to get a clean quadratic polynomial, what's known as the “characteristic polynomial” of the matrix. The eigenvalues are the roots of this polynomial. So to find them you have to apply the quadratic formula, which itself typically requires one or two more steps of simplification.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50Bj7jn9IQ#t=87.89s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	These equations come in two flavors; Ordinary differential equations, or ODEs, involving functions with a single input, often thought of as time, and Partial differential equations, or PDEs, dealing with functions that have multiple inputs. Partial derivatives are something we’ll look at more closely in the next video; you often think of them involving a whole continuum of values changing with time, like the temperature of every point in a solid body, or the velocity of a fluid at every point in space. Ordinary differential equations, our focus for now, involve only a finite collection of values changing with time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=75.34s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	So often in differential equations, the puzzles you face involve finding a function whose derivative and/or higher order derivatives are defined in terms of itself. In physics, it’s most common to work with second order differential equations, which means the highest derivative you find in the expression here is a second derivative. Higher order differential equations would be ones with third derivatives, fourth derivatives and so on; puzzles with more intricate clues.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=297.12s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	In math, we often call a space like this a “phase space”. You’ll hear me use the term broadly for spaces encoding all kinds of states for changing systems, but you should know that in the context of physics, especially Hamiltonian mechanics, the term is often reserved for a special case. Namely, a space whose axes represent position and momentum.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=1099.59s
Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1	It may seem like a simple idea, depending on how well indoctrinated you are to modern ways of thinking about math, but it’s worth keeping in mind that it took humanity quite a while to really embrace thinking of dynamics spatially like this, especially when the dimensions get very large. In his book Chaos, James Gleick describes phase space as “one of the most powerful inventions of modern science.” One reason it’s powerful is that you can ask questions not just about a single initial state, but a whole spectrum of initial states. The collection of all possible trajectories is reminiscent of a moving fluid, so we call it phase flow.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4#t=1147.98s
Music And Measure Theory	Well, this brings us to challenge number 2. Mathematicians like to ask riddles about covering various sets with open intervals, and the answers to these riddles have a strange tendency to become famous lemmas and theorems. By “open interval”, I just mean the continuous stretch of real numbers strictly greater than some number a, but strictly less than some other number b, where b is of course greater than a. My challenge to you involves covering all the rational numbers between 0 and 1 with open intervals. When I say “cover”, all that means is that each particular rational number lies in at least one of your intervals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw#t=324.249s
But what is a convolution?	If instead of evaluating as some arbitrary set of inputs like 0, 1, 2, 3 on and on, you choose to evaluate on a very specially selected set of complex numbers. Specifically the ones that sit evenly spaced on the unit circle, what are known as the roots of unity.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA#t=1160.58s
Who cares about topology?   (Inscribed rectangle problem)	"If you bend the square to perform the gluing, first rolling it into a cylinder to glue the left and right edges then gluing the ends of that cylinder which represent the top and bottom edges we get a ""torus"", better known as the surface of a donut."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8#t=553.92s
Tattoos on Math	Here, let me actually show you all a picture of the tattoo that he chose, because not a lot of people know the geometric representation of the cosecant. Whenever you have an angle, typically represented with the Greek letter theta, it's common in trigonometry to related to a corresponding point on the unit circle, the circle with the radius one centered at the origin in the xy-plane.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNb1WG_Ido#t=88.56s
Cross products | Chapter 10, Essence of linear algebra	So what this means for the operation is that 3v̅×w̅ will be exactly three times the value of v̅×w̅ . Now, even though all of this is a perfectly fine mathematical operation what i just described is technically not the cross-product. The true cross product is something that combines two different 3D vectors to get a new 3D vector. Just as before, we're still going to consider the parallelogram defined by the two vectors that were crossing together. And the area of this parallelogram is still going to play a big role. To be concrete let's say that the area is 2.5 for the vectors shown here but as I said the cross product is not a number it's a vector.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6i7WJeinw#t=289.12s
What is backpropagation really doing? | Chapter 3, Deep learning	Backpropagation, the topic of this video, is an algorithm for computing that crazy complicated gradient. And the one idea from the last video that I really want you to hold firmly in your mind right now is that because thinking of the gradient vector as a direction in 13000 dimensions is, to put it lightly, beyond the scope of our imaginations, there's another way you can think about it: The magnitude of each component here is telling you how sensitive the cost function is to each weight and bias.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U#t=102.95s
What is backpropagation really doing? | Chapter 3, Deep learning	This technique is referred to as “stochastic gradient descent”. There's kind of a lot going on here, so let's just sum it up for ourselves, shall we? Backpropagation is the algorithm for determining how a single training example would like to nudge the weights and biases, not just in terms of whether they should go up or down, but in terms of what relative proportions to those changes cause the most rapid decrease to the cost.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U#t=631.46s
What is backpropagation really doing? | Chapter 3, Deep learning	And this actually transitions really nicely to today's extremely relevant sponsor - CrowdFlower, which is a software platform where data scientists and machine learning teams can create training data. They allow you to upload text or audio or image data, and have it annotated by real people.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U#t=747.87s
Quaternions and 3d rotation, explained interactively	So to set the stage, last video I described quaternions, a certain 4-dimensional number system that the 19th-century versions of Wolverine and the old man from Home Alone called “evil” for how convoluted it seemed at the time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ#t=40.18s
Quaternions and 3d rotation, explained interactively	This mostly works, but one big problem is that it’s vulnerable to is something called “gimbal lock”, where two of your axes of rotation get lined up and you lose a degree of freedom.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ#t=136.8s
Quaternions and 3d rotation, explained interactively	What you do is not just a single quaternion product, but a quaternion sandwich, where you multiply by q from the left and the inverse of q from the right. If you know how i, j and k multiply amongst themselves, you can carry out these two products by expanding everything out, or more likely by having a computer do so.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ#t=292.57s
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra	"As you might have guessed by now, these special vectors are called the ""eigenvectors"" of the transformation, and each eigenvector has associated with it, what's called an ""eigenvalue"", which is just the factor by which it stretched or squashed during the transformation."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g#t=202.61s
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra	Symbolically, here's what the idea of an eigenvector looks like. A is the matrix representing some transformation, with v as the eigenvector, and λ is a number, namely the corresponding eigenvalue. What this expression is saying is that the matrix-vector product - A times v gives the same result as just scaling the eigenvector v by some value λ.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g#t=327.14s
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra	"A set of basis vectors, which are also eigenvectors, is called, again, reasonably enough, an ""eigenbasis"". So if, for example, you needed to compute the 100-th power of this matrix, it would be much easier to change to an eigenbasis, compute the 100-th power in that system, then convert back to our standard system."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g#t=955.77s
The other way to visualize derivatives | Chapter 12, Essence of calculus	Now, what I want to share with you is a way to think about derivatives which I'll refer to as the transformational view, that generalizes more seamlessly into some of those more general context where calculus comes up And then we'll use this alternate view to analyze a certain fun puzzle about repeated fractions.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfW845LNObM#t=78.4s
Fractals are typically not self-similar	[Intro] Who doesn't like fractals?  They're a beautiful blend of simplicity and complexity often including these infinitely repeating patterns. Programmers in particular tend to be especially fond of them, because it often takes a shockingly small amount of code to produce images that are way more intricate than any human hand ever could hope to draw.  But a lot of people don't actually know the definition of a fractal; at least not the one that Benoit Mandelbrot, the father fractal geometry, had in mind.  A common misconception is the fractals are shapes that are perfectly self-similar.  For example this snowflake looking shape right here called the Von Koch snowflake, consists of three different segments, and each one of these is perfectly self-similar, in that when you zoom in on it, you get a perfectly identical copy of the original.  Likewise the famous Sierpinski triangle consists of three smaller identical copies of itself.  And don't get me wrong, self-similar shapes are definitely beautiful, and they're a good toy model for what fractals really, are but Mandelbrot had a much broader conception in mind, one motivated not by beauty, but by a more pragmatic desire to model nature in a way that actually captures roughness.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4#t=0.0s
Fractals are typically not self-similar	It's not really a general notion.  I mean, when we were reasoning about how the mass of a shape should change, it relied on the self similarity of the shapes; that you could build them up from smaller copies of themselves.  But that seems unnecessarily restrictive.  After all, most two-dimensional shapes are not at all self-similar.  Consider the disk, the interior of a circle. We know that it's two-dimensional, and you can say that this is because when you scale it up by a factor of 2, its mass (proportional to the area) gets scaled by the square of that factor, in this case four.  But it's not like there's some way to piece together four copies of that smaller circle to rebuild the original.  So how do we know that the bigger disk is exactly four times the mass of the original?  Answering that requires a way to make this idea of mass a little more mathematically rigorous, since we're not dealing with physical objects made of matter, are we?  We're dealing with purely geometric ones living in an abstract space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4#t=566.44s
Exponential growth and epidemics	Exponential growth means as you go from one day to the next, it involves multiplying by some constant. In our data, the number of cases each day tends to be between 1.15 and 1.25 times the number of cases the previous day.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg#t=44.75s
Exponential growth and epidemics	True exponentials essentially never exist in the real world, they’re all the beginnings of logistic curves. The point where this curve goes from curving up to instead curving down is known as the “inflection point”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg#t=303.479s
Exponential growth and epidemics	At that point, the number of new cases each day, represented by the slope of this curve, is roughly constant, and will soon start decreasing. So one number that people will often follow with epidemics is the “growth factor”, which defined as the ratio between the number of new cases one day, and the number of new cases the previous day.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg#t=316.479s
Exponential growth and epidemics	So, just to be clear, if you were looking at the totals from on day to the next, then tracking the changes between these totals, the growth factor is the ratio between two successive changes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg#t=341.71s
Exponential growth and epidemics	But when you run simulations where there’s even a little bit of travel between the clusters like these, the growth is not actually much different. What you end up with is a kind of fractal pattern, where communities themselves function like individuals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg#t=422.259s
Circle Division Solution (old version)	"The word graph can also refer to a set of points, referred to as ""vertices"", along with a set of lines connecting some of these points which we call ""edges"".  Notice if we count the number of vertices in this graph then subtract the numbers edges, then add the number region this graph cuts space into, along with that outer region, we get 2."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8P8uFahAgc#t=219.8s
Visualizing quaternions (4d numbers) with stereographic projection	What you're looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, or rather, you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion happening on a four-dimensional sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space one which you'll understand by the end of this video.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg#t=0.54s
Visualizing quaternions (4d numbers) with stereographic projection	But on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom: a single number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely. So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all rotations to the one-dimensional continuum that is Linus's world And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you is what's called a stereographic projection It's a special way to map a circle onto a line, or a sphere into a plane, or even a 4d hypersphere into 3d space.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg#t=430.72s
Visualizing quaternions (4d numbers) with stereographic projection	In fact, commutativity—this ability to swap the order of multiplication—is a way more special property than a lot of people realize, and most groups of actions on some space don't have it. It's like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot, Or how rotating a cube about the z axis and then about the x axis gives a different final state from rotating it about the x axis, then about the z axis.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg#t=1741.52s
Other math channels you'd enjoy	Let me turn things over to him to explain what it's all about, both on and off YouTube. James Schloss: LeiosOS is fundamentally a channel about algorithms and works with the Arcane Algorithm Archive, an open source and collaborative effort to document every algorithm in existence in every language possible.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcgJro0sTiM#t=121.8s
Other math channels you'd enjoy	Any light that enters a lens leaves on the other side of the lens with the same angle it came in with. it's almost as if the light never entered the lens at all, and hence the name, the invisible lens.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcgJro0sTiM#t=147.9s
Other math channels you'd enjoy	If we take any arbitrary matrix, say, the identity matrix with zeros along the 𝑤-dimension, the rotation doesn't look quite right. This is because most tesseract depictions use stereographic projections, which resemble the act of holding a light source behind an object and checking a shadow against the screen.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcgJro0sTiM#t=160.88s
Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2, Essence of linear algebra	"When you have a pair of numbers that's meant to describe a vector, like [3, -2], I want you to think about each coordinate as a scalar, meaning, think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors, In the xy-coordinate system, there are two very special vectors: the one pointing to the right with length 1, commonly called ""i-hat"", or the unit vector in the x-direction, and the one pointing straight up, with length 1, commonly called ""j-hat"", or the unit vector in the y-direction."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY#t=32.95s
Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2, Essence of linear algebra	Here's some more terminology: The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination of a given pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY#t=241.38s
Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2, Essence of linear algebra	"The technical definition of a basis of a space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span that space. Now, given how I described a basis earlier, and given your current understanding of the words ""span"" and ""linearly independent"", think about why this definition would make sense."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY#t=552.89s
e to the pi i, a nontraditional take (old version)	You only need to think about turning adders into multipliers. You see, we can also play this game a sliding and stretching in the 2d plane, and this is what complex numbers are. Each numbers simultaneously a point on the plane an adder, which slides the plane so that the point for 0 lands on the point for the number, and multiplayer which fixes zero in place and brings the point for one to the point for the number while keeping everything evenly spaced.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0yfvm0UoU#t=230.62s
Why do prime numbers make these spirals? | Dirichlet’s theorem, pi approximations, and more	Where the Greek letter phi here refers to Euler's totient function, yet another needlessly fancy word Which is defined to be the number of integers from 1 up to n which are coprime to n.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ#t=596.221s
Why do prime numbers make these spirals? | Dirichlet’s theorem, pi approximations, and more	One interesting fact worth mentioning is that it relies heavily on complex analysis. Which is the study of doing calculus with functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers. Now that might seem weird, right? I mean, prime numbers seem wholly unrelated to the continuous world of calculus; Much less when complex numbers end up in the mix.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ#t=1168.021s
Snell's law proof using springs	—3B1B: Snell's law says that sine of theta divided by the speed of light stays constant when light travels from one medium to another, where theta is the angle that that beam of light makes with a line perpendicular to the interface between the two media.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq1a_KJTWJ8#t=216.06s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	Cool, right? To start simple, let's say you have a system with two equations and two unknowns. This means that the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, and v and x are each two dimensional vectors.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=193.14s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	If A was a rightward shear that pushes j-hat one unit to the right, the inverse of a would be a leftward shear that pushes j-hat one unit to the left. In general, A inverse is the unique transformation with the property that if you first apply A, then follow it with the transformation A inverse, you end up back where you started.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=274.78s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"The transformation that does nothing is called the ""identity transformation."" It leaves i-hat and j-hat each where they are, unmoved, so its columns are one, zero, and zero, one. Once you find this inverse, which, in practice, you do with a computer, you can solve your equation by multiplying this inverse matrix by v."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=308.19s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	As long as the transformation A doesn't squish all of space into a lower dimension, meaning, its determinant is nonzero, there will be an inverse transformation, A inverse, with the property that if you first do A, then you do A inverse, it's the same as doing nothing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=376.08s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"If all the vectors land on some two-dimensional plane, We say the transformation has a ""rank"" of two. So the word ""rank"" means the number of dimensions in the output of a transformation."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=495.3s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"This set of all possible outputs for your matrix, whether it's a line, a plane, 3D space, whatever, is called the ""column space"" of your matrix. You can probably guess where that name comes from."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=534.65s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"So, a more precise definition of rank would be that it's the number of dimensions in the column space. When this rank is as high as it can be, meaning it equals the number of columns, we call the matrix ""full rank."" Notice, the zero vector will always be included in the column space, since linear transformations must keep the origin fixed in place."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=562.26s
Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	"If a 3D transformation squishes all the space onto a line, then there's a whole plane full of vectors that land on the origin.

Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7, Essence of linear algebra	It's the space of all vectors that become null, in the sense that they land on the zero vector. In terms of the linear system of equations, when v happens to be the zero vector, the null space gives you all of the possible solutions to the equation.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw#t=639.37s
Matrix multiplication as composition | Chapter 4, Essence of linear algebra	This is worth a quick recap, because it's just really important. But of course, if this feels like more than just a recap, go back and watch the full video. Technically speaking, linear transformations are functions, with vectors as inputs and vectors as outputs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU#t=18.369s
Matrix multiplication as composition | Chapter 4, Essence of linear algebra	Based on how things are written down here I think it's reasonable to call this new matrix, the “product” of the original two matrices. Don't you? We can think about how to compute that product more generally in just a moment, but it's way too easy to get lost in the forest of numbers.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU#t=222.31s
Essence of linear algebra preview	Each has its place, but—roughly speaking—the geometric understanding is what lets you judge what tools to use to solve specific problems, feel why they work, and know how to interpret the results, and the numeric understanding is what lets you actually carry through the application of those tools.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc#t=63.155s
Essence of linear algebra preview	It's not that different with linear algebra, and luckily, just as with trigonometry, there are a handful of intuitions—visual intuitions—underlying much of the subject. And unlike the trig example, the connection between the computation and these visual intuitions is typically pretty straightforward. And when you digest these, and really understand the relationship between the geometry and the numbers, the details of the subject, as well as how it's used in practice, start to feel a lot more reasonable.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc#t=172.695s
Using topology to solve a counting riddle | The Borsuk-Ulam theorem and stolen necklaces	As you do this, many different pairs of points will land on top of each other once it hits the plane, and that’s no big deal. The special fact that we’ll use, known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, is that you will always be able to find a pair of points that started off on exact opposite sides of the sphere, which land on each other during the mapping. Points on the exact opposite side of a sphere are called “antipodes”, or “antipodal points”.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c#t=214.311s
Using topology to solve a counting riddle | The Borsuk-Ulam theorem and stolen necklaces	What I mean by hypersphere is the set of all possible lists of 4-coordinates where the sum of their squares equals 1; those are points in 4d space a distance 1 from the origin.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c#t=1082.8s
Why slicing a cone gives an ellipse	Another is the classic two-thumbtacks-and-a-piece-of-string construction. Loop a string around two thumbtacks in a piece of paper, pull it taut with a pencil, then trace around, keeping the string taut the whole time.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs#t=69.069s
Why slicing a cone gives an ellipse	The curve of points where the plane and cone intersection forms an ellipse, which is why you’ll hear ellipses described as a “conic section”. Of course, an ellipse is not just one curve, it’s a family of curves, ranging from a perfect circle to something infinitely stretched.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs#t=110.42s
Why slicing a cone gives an ellipse	The specific shape of an ellipse is typically quantified in a number called its “eccentricity”, which I sometimes read in my head as “squishification”. A circle has eccentricity 0, and something more squished has an eccentricity closer to 1.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs#t=127.479s
Who cares about topology?   (Inscribed rectangle problem)	"If you bend the square to perform the gluing, first rolling it into a cylinder to glue the left and right edges then gluing the ends of that cylinder which represent the top and bottom edges we get a ""torus"", better known as the surface of a donut."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8#t=553.92s
Circle Division Solution (old version)	"The word graph can also refer to a set of points, referred to as ""vertices"", along with a set of lines connecting some of these points which we call ""edges"".  Notice if we count the number of vertices in this graph then subtract the numbers edges, then add the number region this graph cuts space into, along with that outer region, we get 2."	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8P8uFahAgc#t=219.8s
